I\u2019m looking for an opportunity that aligns with my passions and my work experience related to efficiency and productivity. In Intel\u2019s manufacturing and purchasing teams I found ways to streamline processes and reduce confusion and conflict. In my marketing experience for a non-profit I expanded the use of charts and graphs to better understand and grow the base of support. I\u2019m not just seeking a management position. I\u2019m good with people, I\u2019m a team player and my hope is to experience a new environment where I can use my best skills to make the maximum contribution.
