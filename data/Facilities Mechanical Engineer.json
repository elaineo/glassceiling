Surveying Technician Intern Fermilab June 2009  \u2013  September 2009  (4 months) Batavia, IL While working with engineers and surveyors in the metrology and alignment group I was able to develop a survey control network and streamline field data collection. The data we collected was used to locate and align system components of a particle accelerator relative to a control network and to each other within a specification of 50 mils. Due to the limited machine shutdown schedule we had three months to collect and analyze our data in order to make appropriate adjustments to achieve an ultimate machine level design spec of four inches over a four mile circumference. Electrical Engineering Intern City of St. Charles, Illinois June 2008  \u2013  September 2008  (4 months) St. Charles, IL The engineering team I was assigned to had no plan of record for the city electrical distribution grid. As one of the first steps to create an as built plan of record, I visually located and recorded every transformer location, switchgear service distribution, and phase transfer within the city limits. To provide easy information access for city engineers I helped to integrate the electric distribution information I collected into the city\u2019s global information system (GIS). \n \nWhile working with experienced electrical engineers I learned the fundamentals of electric distribution, as well as how voltage is divided and phases are optimized for transportation and consumption. The knowledge I learned from this experience helped me build a solid understanding of electricity and how it integrates with mechanical equipment.

Surveying Technician Intern Fermilab June 2009  \u2013  September 2009  (4 months) Batavia, IL While working with engineers and surveyors in the metrology and alignment group I was able to develop a survey control network and streamline field data collection. The data we collected was used to locate and align system components of a particle accelerator relative to a control network and to each other within a specification of 50 mils. Due to the limited machine shutdown schedule we had three months to collect and analyze our data in order to make appropriate adjustments to achieve an ultimate machine level design spec of four inches over a four mile circumference.

Electrical Engineering Intern City of St. Charles, Illinois June 2008  \u2013  September 2008  (4 months) St. Charles, IL The engineering team I was assigned to had no plan of record for the city electrical distribution grid. As one of the first steps to create an as built plan of record, I visually located and recorded every transformer location, switchgear service distribution, and phase transfer within the city limits. To provide easy information access for city engineers I helped to integrate the electric distribution information I collected into the city\u2019s global information system (GIS). \n \nWhile working with experienced electrical engineers I learned the fundamentals of electric distribution, as well as how voltage is divided and phases are optimized for transportation and consumption. The knowledge I learned from this experience helped me build a solid understanding of electricity and how it integrates with mechanical equipment.
