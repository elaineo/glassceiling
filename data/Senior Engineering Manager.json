Used Visual C++, Windows Sockets. \n* Designed and coded Version 1 of SNMP Agent, MIB Compiler and SMUX API library Staff Engineer ESQ 1993  \u2013  1997  (4 years) Designed, coded and shipped 4 products in my time at ESQ \nresponsible for integrations with Tandem systems at many Major banks including Barclays Bank, BofA, WellsFargo etc. \n \nI was also involved in writing a complete SNMP stack, along with a complete visual plugin for HP OpenView that auto discovered your entire network and then allowed Command and Control from a central place. \n \n* Coded the OpenNET/InterVIEW product under HP OpenView and IBM NetView/6000 to draw hierarchical maps, provide object selection, graphicalCommand/Control and Menus, with SNMP as the communication protocol standard.Used X11, Xt and Motif 1.2. \n* Developed a Work Force Management System, integrated with Action Request Help Desk facility for McCaw Cellular Inc., coded using C, RPC, Solaris 2.3 and ARS API. \n* Designed and prototyped the OpenNET/Interview product. This product extends HP/OpenView and IBM NetView/6000 to have non-IP discovery, automatic discovery and layout of object hierarchy of Tandem subsystems, and GUI based command control. \n* Conceived and implemented the concept of an Object DataBase Manager (ODBM) and automatic discovery process. The ODBM discovered, monitored and maintained information about objects on Tandem platforms, and most importantly provided an asynchronous API supporting SNMP, TCP/IP and NetBIOS. This is an SQL (Oracle) based product. \n* Conceived, Designed and coded the SNMP-to-Remedy Manager Product. This is an X-Motif application that enabled automatic submission of Trouble Tickets to Action Request System from network generated SNMP Traps. The mapping is completely user configurable. \n* Designed and developed WinPTG product. This is MS-Windows application that extended the Source Control capability of PVCS product to the Tandem Platforms.
