I\u2019ve given talks at conferences and to graduate students in auditoriums at USC, Carnegie Mellon, and The Tokyo Institute of Technology. However I didn\u2019t \u201cwant-to-be\u201d an academic enough as I turned down PhD program acceptances at Yale and Columbia in favor of working in the exciting world known as the technology industry. Malcolm Gladwell would say that I invested my most recent 10,000 hours for expertise in \u201cIBM.\u201d While this doesn\u2019t always translate to the outside world, it essentially means that I\u2019ve been asked to take on such a wide variety of challenges in my eight years here that I know just enough about most things to be dangerous. But whether it was cities, semiconductors, or CFOs, I\u2019ve always looked at each new challenge through the lens of an entrepreneur. I put my business development and management consulting skills to work, adding the creativity and imagination to envision the possible, and then the leadership to get everyone together to make something from nothing. The result is first-of-a-kind programs, new businesses, licensing revenue, effective strategies, new insights from analytics, cultural change, publications, and even a patent. \n \nWho is Justin Cook? Some call me a \u201cwant-to-be academic,\u201d a claim largely supported by the evidence. I enjoy things like analytics competitions and I liked business school so much I essentially went twice. The first time was for a B.S. at Wharton and then I went back again many years later for an MBA at MIT Sloan.
