The case study required analysis of inventory, policies, and layout in order to develop a project plan that improved current operations. Recommendations included reorganization of SKUs, changing pick-place policies, and investing in material handling equipment. Cost benefit analysis was conducted to verify our recommendations were more profitable than contracting a 3PL service. Dean's List Achieved Dean's List in 8 quarters between 2005 and 2011.
