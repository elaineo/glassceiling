Meanwhile, I am very fortunate to be a visiting scholar at Stanford to continue my translational research on a longitudinal cohort of patients with ABPA under the mentoring of Dr. Moss (Professor of Pediatrics at the Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital) and Dr. Herzenberg (Professor [Research] of Genetics). Visiting resident Alameda County Hospital April 2014  \u2013  May 2014  (2 months) Bethesda I spent my clinical elective rotation at the NIH/NIAID to learn how to manage patients with rare immunodeficiencies. Given the rarity of these diseases, the management approach was based on experimental molecular therapy designed to specifically target the newly identified immune dysfunction. Clinical and basic research was the foundation of these novel treatments. Clinical Fellow Stanford University School of Medicine July 2012  \u2013  October 2012  (4 months) Stanford Hospital I was seeing patients with allergy or immunodeficiency, under an exemption of the Medical Board of California (exemption 2111), under the supervision of Dr. Sean McGhee, Director of the Allergy and Immunology Fellowship program at Stanford. I became familiar with many conditions such as chronic granulomatous disease, food induced enterocolitis syndrom, toll like receptor deficiency. This experience has confirmed my passion for managing children and adults with Allergy and/or Immunodeficiency. Clinical Research Fellow Stanford University School of Medicine January 2008  \u2013  October 2012  (4 years 10 months) Stanford University School of Medicine In 2008, I returned to Stanford as a post-doctoral fellow to explore the role granulocytes in another atopic disease, food allergy. Under the combined mentorship of Drs. Nadeau, Tirouvanziam, Prs Galli and Herzenberg, I took a leading role in developing direct multi-parameter methods for basophil and eosinophil analysis in whole blood. This work led to several abstracts, publications and patents. I defended my PhD in September 2011, and received the best Honors. At Stanford, now equipped with experience in translational research on CF and allergy, I am currently applying my skills to Cystic Fibrosis-Allergic BronchoPulmonary Aspergillosis (CF-ABPA) under the mentorship of Prof. Moss while performing residency in Internal Medicine. I expect results to lead to a better understanding of CF-ABPA and potentially to the development of a novel, clinically relevant test. Such a test could usher in earlier treatment and better prognosis for CF-ABPA patients.
