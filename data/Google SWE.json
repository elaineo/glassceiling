Senior Software Engineer Four Lights - ServiceMagic.com June 2000  \u2013  November 2000  (6 months) Used J2EE (JSP, EJB, Servlets), Java Mail, JRun, Netscape Enterprise Server, XML, XSL, HTML, and PGP to build an HTML email generator. Information is extracted from an Oracle 8i database by JSP\u2019s and Java Beans and then sent to users as an HTML page via Java Mail. Also designed and wrote a matching engine using EJB\u2019s and JDBC to match service requestors with service providers. Chris participated in the Agile Software development process that was in place for the various software development projects.

Senior Software Engineer Four Lights - GE Capital Mortgage October 1999  \u2013  June 2000  (9 months) Used JavaScript, Java Servlets, JRun, Netscape Enterprise Server, and HTML to design and build a web-based workflow system. JavaScript and HTML are used at the front end to talk to Java Servlets on the backend. The Java Servlets in turn communicate with a CORBA layer that accesses certain business rules and exchanges information with an Oracle 8i database.

Software Engineer Evolving Systems December 1992  \u2013  January 1996  (3 years 2 months) Ameritech Project \nArchitect/Software Engineer \nJune 1994 \u2013 June 1997 \n\u2022\tDesigned and created the ASFAR Trouble Ticketing System for this major telecommunications entity. Responsible for design, implementation and tuning of the Informix database, as well as modifications to the application to improve multi-threaded performance. This high-volume application was built using C++ and Motif to access a networked Informix database. Recent enhancements include an HTML interface, which enables users to report and track outages via the Internet. \n \nTandem Project \nSoftware Engineer \n\u2022\tDesigned and developed an API based on Bellcore specifications to interface an Intelligent Peripheral with ISCP s. This API allows developers to write 1129+ messages using a high level interface rather than TCAP specifications. Technical Lead/Architect on the Intelligent Peripheral project to develop an Informix-based IP solution using SS7 messaging in a Tandem environment.  \n \nGTE Project \nSoftware Engineer \n\u2022\tDeveloped high-volume, VLDB application for a major telecommunications client. The system included a GUI built with Borland C++ that used Informix ESQL/C and I-NET to exchange information with an HP T500.
