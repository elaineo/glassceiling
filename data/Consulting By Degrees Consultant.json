Metro Area IE/Supplier Management Intern Boeing May 2014  \u2013  August 2014  (4 months) Seattle, WA As a part of the analytics team in Supplier Management of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, I worked on multiple valuable projects throughout the course of my internship. The following gives a brief summary of my experience: \n- The main project that I was presented with was the task of lowering supplier lead times. It was a complex situation with a lot of variables and challenges, but in the end I was able to create a dynamic lead time model that utilized a ranking algorithm and reduced the suppliers' lead time by over 30%. I then collaborated with TMX Aerospace to create an automated lead time matrix in which suppliers would use to place orders.  \n- My second project was to do an analysis on the current metal inventory. Through the use of access and excel, I was able to identify over 100,000 lbs of remnant pieces that were obsolete for operation. \n- Finally, I was asked to look into one of the inventory warehouses in the supply chain. This warehouse was in a poor strategical location and management wanted me to find out the logistics of possibly shutting it down. I identified that 24% of the part numbers accounted for 80% of the inventory. I then focused on those part numbers and made recommendations to use/scrap/relocate that material over the next several years. Analyst Connors Group January 2013  \u2013  August 2013  (8 months) At Connors Group, I got my first taste of consulting and loved it. Interacting with clients on a day to day basis sharpened my communication skills and made me much more professional. While I was there, I got to work on some beneficial projects. The following is a summary of my experience: \n- When working for a convenience store chain, I studied the store's pack out process of non-vendor items that were delivered to the store twice a week. Using a predetermined motion time system, I developed over 15 engineering labor standards. \n- Across several projects, I conducted multiple time studies and analyzed the data to find underlying customer patterns and trends. This analysis gave the clients vital insight to their customers' shopping patterns. \n- Throughout the course of my internship, I collaborated with different team members to work on numerous process improvement ideas that saved clients substantial amounts of money. \n- Finally, I got the privilege to work on several projects with some of the largest apparel retailers in the country. I even worked internationally in Canada with a family run grocery store.

Metro Area IE/Supplier Management Intern Boeing May 2014  \u2013  August 2014  (4 months) Seattle, WA As a part of the analytics team in Supplier Management of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, I worked on multiple valuable projects throughout the course of my internship. The following gives a brief summary of my experience: \n- The main project that I was presented with was the task of lowering supplier lead times. It was a complex situation with a lot of variables and challenges, but in the end I was able to create a dynamic lead time model that utilized a ranking algorithm and reduced the suppliers' lead time by over 30%. I then collaborated with TMX Aerospace to create an automated lead time matrix in which suppliers would use to place orders.  \n- My second project was to do an analysis on the current metal inventory. Through the use of access and excel, I was able to identify over 100,000 lbs of remnant pieces that were obsolete for operation. \n- Finally, I was asked to look into one of the inventory warehouses in the supply chain. This warehouse was in a poor strategical location and management wanted me to find out the logistics of possibly shutting it down. I identified that 24% of the part numbers accounted for 80% of the inventory. I then focused on those part numbers and made recommendations to use/scrap/relocate that material over the next several years.

Analyst Connors Group January 2013  \u2013  August 2013  (8 months) At Connors Group, I got my first taste of consulting and loved it. Interacting with clients on a day to day basis sharpened my communication skills and made me much more professional. While I was there, I got to work on some beneficial projects. The following is a summary of my experience: \n- When working for a convenience store chain, I studied the store's pack out process of non-vendor items that were delivered to the store twice a week. Using a predetermined motion time system, I developed over 15 engineering labor standards. \n- Across several projects, I conducted multiple time studies and analyzed the data to find underlying customer patterns and trends. This analysis gave the clients vital insight to their customers' shopping patterns. \n- Throughout the course of my internship, I collaborated with different team members to work on numerous process improvement ideas that saved clients substantial amounts of money. \n- Finally, I got the privilege to work on several projects with some of the largest apparel retailers in the country. I even worked internationally in Canada with a family run grocery store.
