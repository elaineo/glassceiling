OTA architectures include telescopic cascade, folded cascade, two stage high gain, single stage, rail to rail. These OTA designs are realized with efficient bias generator circuits and low power for portable and wireless applications. Power supply rejection ration (PSRR), common mode rejection ratio (CMRR), slew rate and noise specifications were considered during the design of a specific OTA. Close loop gain of the OTA is realized using the Middlebrook technique and noise performance is realized by resizing the input device sizes for the OTA. \n \n \nDAC: Design and analysis of Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) using the Matlab scripts. Using the matlab scripts proper partition is obtained to design a segmented DAC e.g. for 10 bit DAC, the partition between the unit element DAC and binary weighted DAC sections.
