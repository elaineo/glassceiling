Experience Senior Software Engineer Intel Corporation - Retail Solutions Division (IOTG -> RSD) October 2013  \u2013 Present (1 year 11 months) Chandler, Arizona \u2022 Part of the development team for Retail Client Manager, Intel's digital content management product. \n\u2022 Team Lead for Remote Control capability, which allows browser-based remote management of devices in-band (when the OS is up) and out-of-band through AMT (when the OS is down). Senior Software Engineer Intel Corporation - Design Tools Development (TMG -> ATTD -> Design -> DTD) November 2009  \u2013  October 2013  (4 years) Chandler, Arizona \u2022 Repurposed two mature desktop tools for external use by Original Device and Equipment Manufacturers (ODMs and OEMs). The tools validate CAD schematic and layout board files against Intel Platform Design Guidelines and display violations. \n- Architected the solution, managed the projects, and technically led the team comprised of employees and contractors across multiple geographies. Embraced Agile software practices, tracked resources, and reported-out to management regularly. \n- The user interfaces (UIs) are built with ASP.NET MVC 3, AJAX, and jQuery. A file upload control written in Silverlight 5 allows for very large files (hundreds of megabytes) to be uploaded with real-time feedback. The control communicates with multiple Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) 4 services, and uses Entity Framework 4.2 to store files as SQL Server 2008 R2 FILESTREAM data. \n- A managed wrapper, running on multiple application servers, leverages the desktop tools\u2019 enormous CPU-intensive unmanaged code base. \n- Personally developed the queue-based back-end services which connect the tiers.
