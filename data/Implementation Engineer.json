The aim of the project was to design and construct an AC voltage measurement circuit for voltages below three-phase 400V AC and use it to obtain a real time reading of amplitude and phase angle. This was done by building and integrating different circuits such as resistive voltage divider, low-pass filter, voltage offset circuit and software phase locked loop (PLL). The software phase locked loop was designed using a digital signal processor (DSP) which was programmed in C language. This project also required detailed Matlab simulations of the PLL which was carried out before the implementation on the digital signal processor.
