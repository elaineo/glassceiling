Consulting Limited, Oakville, Canada October 2005  \u2013  July 2011  (5 years 10 months) In this role, I provided consulting services on the physical layer aspects of the 3GPP WCDMA/UMTS and LTE standards. I have designed scalable transmitter entities generating the downlink signals, including RS, synchronization signals, L1/L2 control channels and the broadcast channel, for the FDD mode of the LTE. On the WCDMA side, I have provided fixed-point designs/algorithms for both the transmitter and receiver sides of pico-cell base-stations. These have included QAM modulators, FHT, spreading and scrambling code generators, DPCH, S-CCPCH, HS-SCCH, HS-PDSCH, AICH, PICH, RACH preamble and TFCI detection algorithms and transmitter scaling mechanisms under power control. I verified the effectiveness of these by Matlab simulations and worked closely with FPGA/DSP engineers to ensure their successful implementation within project timelines. Senior Algorithms Engineer Ubinetics Limited/Aeroflex, Cambridge, UK August 2003  \u2013  June 2005  (1 year 11 months) Design of downlink receiver algorithms for company\u2019s WCDMA/UMTS based system-on-chip project and popular TM500 test mobile products were amongst my main responsibilities in this role. Provision of physical layer system support to various company teams/groups, investigation of more advanced receiver solutions, building WCDMA and LTE based link level Matlab simulators, fixed-point design/implementation of receiver algorithms using C were amongst my other responsibilities. In this period, I originated a number of peer-reviewed publications and patent proposals. Senior Systems Engineer AT&T Wireless / Netro Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA February 2001  \u2013  February 2003  (2 years 1 month) In this capacity, I designed and developed novel downlink transceiver algorithms for the AT&T\u2019s OFDM based fixed-wireless Angel product. The designs included efficient synchronization, frequency tracking and SINR estimation techniques. Link level Matlab simulations were used to examine the effectiveness of the designs in various multipath channel scenarios. I also worked with RF hardware design engineers to design flexible RF filtering schemes for the next generation products. In this role, I submitted a multitude of patent proposals and was the author of numerous white papers. DSP Algorithms Consultant NEC Technologies (UK) Ltd, Reading, UK August 1999  \u2013  February 2001  (1 year 7 months) As the lead engineer in the WCDMA/UMTS algorithms design team, I was responsible for the direction of the team\u2019s activities and for the coordination of the team\u2019s efforts with those of NEC Japan and Australia. The focus of my work was on the design of NEC\u2019s handset cell search algorithm and solutions to the problems associated with its practical implementation. My work during this period resulted in numerous inventions, patent submissions and the NEC\u2019s patent of the Year 2000 award. Principal Engineer Fujitsu Europe Telecom R&D Centre, Uxbridge, UK April 1997  \u2013  July 1999  (2 years 4 months) I joined Fujitsu during the early days of WCDMA/UMTS standardization activities and amongst my first responsibilities was participation in the standardization meetings as the company representative. In parallel, I was involved in other technical activities resulting in generation of novel WCDMA-related algorithms and consequently patent proposals. I also provided a real-time flexible DSP-based solution for the Fujitsu\u2019s WCDMA adaptive antenna array product, which I fully implemented using the Texas Instruments fixed-point TMS320C60. Research Associate (postdoctoral research) Centre for Communications Research, University of Bristol, UK October 1994  \u2013  March 1997  (2 years 6 months) At CCR, I was responsible for a UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) funded project. In this project, I built a frequency hopping (FH) simulator modeling the modules of the FH transceiver together with a controllable multipath channel in C++. Subsequently, I implemented the transceiver modules and a real-time channel model in hardware and in DSP code using TI\u2019s TMS320C30 and C40.
