Within first year I was promoted to Practice Manager for the Network Management practice group and from there consulted and managed my consulting staff on over 30 projects for over a dozen Tier 1 Carriers, as well as commercial customers, with the most key being in charge of developing the network management agents and applications in support of McCaw Cellular's (ATT Wireless) data networks and subsequent development and deployment of CDPD. Other significant projects included network management design and deployments for Chubb Insurance, John Deere & Co., Smith Barney, Proctor and Gamble, revamps of NOCs for two carriers (MCI and Ameritech) as well as FedEx's GCOC, and support of the Divisional Advanced Warfighter (DAWE) project with the US Army. Consultant & Instructor The Matrix Organization / CGI Systems, Inc. 1989  \u2013  1993  (4 years) CAT II NetWare instructor and network consultant with The Matrix Organization, which became CGI and subsequently was acquired by IBM. It was at this time I began focus on network management, moving from initial learning of protocol analyzers through to NMS platforms (HPOV, NetExpert, Ciscoworks, etc). During that time I worked on design, deployment and management of very large scale networks, ran a key network operating system performance analysis study, was architect of the network for the US Olympic Festival in San Antonio, served on many trade show boards of advisors while writing and presenting a number of tutorials and dozens of panel / session presentations, and wrote a number of articles that ran in leading trade journals (such as LAN Magazine, ComputerWorld, PC Magazine).
