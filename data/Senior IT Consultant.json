As part of IBM\u2019s graduate programme I also had the opportunity to participate in a range of IBM official training on topics including Project Management, Leadership, Agile Methodology, and Presentation Skills. \n \nThe majority of my experience has been in the Release and Deployment space, where I have developed a range of experience in process development, release documentation, shell scripting, release management and deployment management of up to 140 Java artifacts to a large and complex system. \n \nI also have experience in ITIL service management, focussing on Incident and Problem Management process in particular. This experience was gained in the Environments team on a large programme of work. \n \nDuring the latter part of 2014 I spent several months working as a Business Analyst on a Large Confidential Programme of work.

Christmas Cookie Seller Cookie Time Limited October 2013  \u2013  December 2013  (3 months) Porirua and the Kapiti Coast I had the pleasure of being part of the Cookie Time Christmas Cookies Campaign in 2013 as a Christmas Cookie seller to the Porirua/Kapiti region, just north of Wellington. \n \nAs a Christmas Cookie Seller I ran my own business, managing everything from sales and marketing to stock management, distribution and banking. \n \nThe campaign is run over about six weeks each year; three of these weeks are spent selling (essentially cold calling) thousands of businesses in my territory. The latter three weeks are spent delivering cookies; In the end I smashed my target of 3,000 buckets of cookies selling a total of 3,455 buckets - or roughly 293,675 Christmas Cookies.  \n \nFrankly, life as a Christmas Cookie Seller was a lot tougher than I had anticipated. As a result of the limited time period in which Christmas Cookies are sold, visiting every business in my territory was tough and meant being on the road selling/delivering during business hours, before returning home to reply to emails, enter orders, count stock and load the car each night. At times, this meant I worked up to 19 hours a day and over 80 hours a week. Junior Associate First Monday August 2013  \u2013  October 2013  (3 months) Wellington & Wairarapa, New Zealand As a Junior Associate at First Monday, I assisted the director in a variety of situations aiding the establishment of the business.  \n \nWork included: Analysis of potential email, calendar and web site platforms, as well as a more technical perspective which included the implementation of the use of these systems within the business.

LPG Compliance Administrator Contact Energy Ltd May 2011  \u2013  December 2011  (8 months) Wellington As LPG Compliance Administrator I worked with a project team to develop business processes and systems to support LPG Compliance Activities. The project faced significant pressure with heavy time constraints and regularly changing requirements but overall was a very rewarding experience.  \nI also developed a variety of Microsoft Access Databases, including reports, forms and complicated queries.  \nI was the subject matter expert for LPG Compliance within the business and therefore fielded a wide variety of inquiries from both inside and outside the business, including customers, test certifiers and the Environmental Protection Authority. \nAt times, I managed mailouts to up to 1000 customers while facing significant data integrity challenges.  \nFinally I also worked with retail trainers to develop training packs and call scripts used to train the customer services team. Compliance Telemarketing Assistant Contact Energy Ltd January 2011  \u2013  May 2011  (5 months) In this role I was responsible for outbound calling to several thousand existing Contact Rockgas customers.
