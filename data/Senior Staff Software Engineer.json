Carl drove the vision of making any surface into an interactive display surface. He developed an all-in-one small form factor compute device with a projector, depth camera, and connectivity, client/server architecture that allows any surface/client to talk to any other device (Interactive bowl could interact with Immersive wall), new interactive touch client for planar and non-planar surfaces, programmed iOS and Android app for interacting with display wall, analyzed many depth sensors (structured light, time of flight, and LIDAR), developed ultrasonic proximity sensor via smartphones, and developed Intel Smartroom interactive display surface to automatically allow presenter selection.
