In order to do this, I utilized the theory of systems dynamics modeling to help conceptualize and parameterize the issues surrounding resilience. My thesis proposed a systems dynamics framework to help inform resilience programming and identified critical components that should be targeted by effective projects & initiatives. The work also proposed the idea of an \u201cadaptive-capacity bottleneck\u201d as a phenomenon preventing effective policy-making.

DB2 Kernel Infrastructure Engineer IBM June 2008  \u2013  January 2009  (8 months) Portland, Oregon Behind giants like WalMart and Goldman Sachs are enormous databases powered by IBM's DB2 technology. I was an intern on the team that developed a new shared-disk cluster technology that enabled these types of systems to scale-up even more than competitors. Specifically, I scoped, designed and implemented the self-tuning memory management and automatic configuration components for the new DB2 architecture. In plain English, my job was to make the database system \"smart\" by having it automatically reconfigure itself for optimal performance. \n \nIBM is huge and working on a globally distributed engineering team of 600+ DB2 developers and 350k+ employees was quite fascinating.

Used ocean model results combined with atmospheric observations of delta 13C and CO2 to constrain interannual variability in disequilibrium flux, a one-way isoflux of old carbon to the atmosphere. Worked to classify recent trends in global net uptake of CO2 by the combined ocean and land sinks. PhD Work and Research Assistantship INSTAAR - University of Colorado Boulder 2007  \u2013  November 2013  (6 years) Boulder, Colorado Developed a gridscale Bayesian inversion model for 13C of biosphere-atmosphere fluxes of CO2 over the North American continent. This work will shed light on links between surface-atmosphere fluxes of carbon, water and energy, because of the close connections between plant stomatal conductance of carbon and water. Used ocean model results combined with atmospheric observations of delta 13C and CO2 to constrain interannual variability in disequilibrium flux, a one-way isoflux of old carbon to the atmosphere. Worked to classify recent trends in global net uptake of CO2 by the combined ocean and land sinks.
