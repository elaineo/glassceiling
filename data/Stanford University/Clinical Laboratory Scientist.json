This means matching patients and donors for transplantation as well as monitoring patients before and after transplant. Often there are severe time limitations, high stress, and a focus on accuracy. Main responsibilities include: low and high resolution sequencing (SSP, SSOP, Sequencing), antibody identification and strength, flow crossmatching between cells and serum, QC, troubleshooting, inventory, and education.
