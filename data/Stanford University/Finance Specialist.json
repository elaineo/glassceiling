My portfolio is comprised of operating budgets, sponsored projects, gift, discretionary, and income accounts. In addition to the day-to-day responsibilities like approving procurement orders, reimbursements, and other financial transactions, an important part of my role is to work with Program Directors and Assistant/Associate Deans on the development of annual operating budgets for their respective units. Manager, Financial Planning & Analysis The Wilderness Society April 2014  \u2013  August 2014  (5 months) San Francisco Bay Area Overseeing all grants-related activities, I am responsible not only for pre- and post-award management but also driving accounting processes like booking revenue and balance sheet accounts reconciliation. Besides contracts and grants management, another part of my role is to work closely with our Regional Directors, located across the U.S., on operating costs management and budget planning for their divisions. Financial Analyst UCSF October 2011  \u2013  March 2014  (2 years 6 months) San Francisco Bay Area I managed and forecasted spending, oversaw GL reconciliation process, facilitated ongoing communications with clients and senior management in regards to budget status, and ensured all reporting requirements are met; so my clients could focus more on their research and less on the numbers. In addition to fulfilling the role of a financial analyst, I also took great pride in serving as an account manager. This helped to build trust. Even when I was unable to approve my clients' requests sometimes, they still understood my decision was made to protect them. Research Services Analyst UCSF January 2011  \u2013  October 2011  (10 months) San Francisco Bay Area As a pre-award research services analyst, I was like a mysterious bin that somehow turned scattered pieces of information into a finished proposal. Before a turkey can be baked to golden brown, the preparation process included data and content collection, budget development, proofreading, inter-departmental communications, and most importantly, time management. Managing multiple projects at the same time was as usual of an activity as going to work. Deadlines were my best friend and also worst enemy; but in either perspective, they kept me on track. Compliance Assistant RCM September 2009  \u2013  June 2010  (10 months) San Francisco Bay Area My primary role was to help administering the company's Code of Ethics process by monitoring employees' personal trading accounts and reviewing analysis results.
