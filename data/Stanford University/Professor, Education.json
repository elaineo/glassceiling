Member Teacher Leaders Network 2006  \u2013 Present (9 years) Strategy & thought leadership Artist Much Too Bright 1995  \u2013 Present (20 years) My paintings investigate the intimate relationship between man-made structures and the natural environment. I am fascinated by the way the two types of space affect each other. The Inside Outbuildings series explores how nature pushes back against man's structures, often committing slow violence against the offending structures. Outbuildings are created for entirely functional reasons. Water, bugs, and sunlight decay these buildings over a long period of time. Because they are entirely functional and still useful as they decay, they are often are not \"kept up\" by the people who use them. These paintings show landscapes framed by the buildings in them. They show patterns, colors, and shadows that rest just outside of abstract. I maintain my fidelity to the subject matter while bending the painting\u2019s execution towards abstraction, creating an aesthetically beautiful painting that acknowledges the history of the landscape.
