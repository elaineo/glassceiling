Experience Senior Research Associate Stanford University School of Medicine August 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 1 month) Stanford, California I am currently working on developing further computational methods for resolving local ancestry in admixed populations, building on methods previously developed in Carlos Bustamante's group at Stanford. The methodology is based on machine learning techniques, specifically a random forest classifier combined with maximizing the conditional random field over the random forest classification probabilities for discrete windows across the genome of fixed genetic size. Primary goals are to improve scalability of the method to very large datasets in terms of both markers and individuals, and to improve usability for both users at large and users internal to our group. Secondary goals, being pursued in tandem, are to refine accuracy and sensitivity and perform extensive validation of the program. \n \nI am also interested in recently developed long read high throughput sequencing and exploring pilot datasets as they become available to the lab. The pros and cons of different approaches coming to market are not clear and depend on the use case. My work currently involves data from an early, low coverage variant of the moleculo synthetic long read technology but is expanding in the near future to newer technologies and higher sequencing depths as costs continue to decrease.

Work for this position fell largely into two categories: (1) website and database programming, development, and integration, and (2) development of continually improving methods for assemblies of EST sequences into unigene (contig) sequences. The database I developed, and its web interface, tracked all data from physical location of a cDNA clone in a freezer to every chromatogram generated, base calling sequence of that chromatogram, and every version of a unigene build as well as annotations of that sequence which followed. This became the basis of the SOL genomics network (http://solgenomics.net/) and much of what I developed is still present and functional on the present day site.

Work for this position fell largely into two categories: (1) website and database programming, development, and integration, and (2) development of continually improving methods for assemblies of EST sequences into unigene (contig) sequences. The database I developed, and its web interface, tracked all data from physical location of a cDNA clone in a freezer to every chromatogram generated, base calling sequence of that chromatogram, and every version of a unigene build as well as annotations of that sequence which followed. This became the basis of the SOL genomics network (http://solgenomics.net/) and much of what I developed is still present and functional on the present day site. Additional duties involved all system and network administration for both the bioinformatics group and the computer needs of the larger wet lab researchers.

Demonstrated their use in a new route for synthetic organic chemistry as they facilitate reactions between organic substrates and hydrophilic nucleophiles to a much greater degree than conventional microemulsions in organic solvents. Lowered the surfactant concentration by an order of magnitude compared to the case of microemulsions in organic solvents and achieved comparable product yields.
