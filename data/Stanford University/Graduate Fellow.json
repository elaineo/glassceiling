Kumu Networks has invented a cancellation technology that allows a radio to transmit and receive on the same frequency at the same time. Full-duplex technology is widely applicable across many wireless standards (LTE, WiFi, Whitespaces, etc.), and it has many valuable use-cases without requiring any standards modifications. Jeff leads engineering for Kumu Networks. \n \nJeff is currently on leave from the Ph.D. program at Stanford University, where he was working on full-duplex wireless and OpenRadio, which seeks to bring software-defined networking concepts to wireless RAN infrastructure. Before Stanford, Jeff co-founded OutSmart Power Systems, where he developed smart building networks to aid energy efficiency. He also worked as a design engineer with Sensata Technologies, developing low-cost, safety-critical automotive sensors.

I plan to conduct cross-cultural studies of group- and relation-motivated social action in Korea and China. Research Associate University of Washington August 2010  \u2013  June 2011  (11 months) While at the University of Washington I theorized the differences between the internal and external legitimacy of the North Korean regime. I argue that North Korea, as well the other (post-)socialist Asian societies of China and Vietnam, claim legitimacy on the basis of promoting economic prosperity and maintaining ethno-political sovereignty. \n \nThrough a meta-analysis of six surveys conducted with North Korean migrants in China and South Korea, I found evidence that while North Korean migrants believe their government is economically incompetent, they do not necessarily believe that it is politically illegitimate.
