Elizabeth's research examines the ethnic-racial identity development and academic adjustment of ethnic-racial minority and (im)migrant youth. Her current work examines the emotions evoked by discrimination, in particular shame, anger, and pride, and their relationship to the ethnic-racial attitudes of Indigenous Mexican adolescents and young adults. Her previous work examined the emotions and ambiguous loss experienced by Latino youth following the deportation of a parent.

Our main focus is to contribute substantially to improving binational scholarly understanding and providing positive contributions to society in both Mexico and the United States, particularly in the graduate and professional areas. Ford Foundation Pre-Doctoral Fellowship Ford Foundation 2009 Predoctoral fellowships are awarded in a national competition administered by the National Research Council (NRC) on behalf of the Ford Foundation. The awards are made to individuals who, in the judgment of the review panels, have demonstrated superior academic achievement, are committed to a career in teaching and research at the college or university level, show promise of future achievement as scholars and teachers, and are well prepared to use diversity as a resource for enriching the education of all students.  Eugene V. Cota-Robles Fellowship 2009 The Eugene Cota\u2010Robles (ECR) Fellowship Program, initiated in 1989\u201090, provides mentored fellowship support to students who are enrolled in doctoral programs at the University.

", "Summary I\u2019m broadly interested in social cognition, its neural underpinnings, and related change dynamics. More specifically, I focus on the interplay between processes involved in self perception and the perception of others (person perception), with an emphasis on examining development and individual differences. In one line of research, I\u2019m working to understand social influences and biological substrates of pro-social and risky decision making during adolescence. A second line of research investigates predictors of change in personality over the lifespan. Prior work has focused on the neural basis of empathy development during the biological and social transition to adolescence. \n \nComputationally intensive analytic techniques are instrumental for learning about processes of change from large data sets. Tools I employ include multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, machine learning, and neuroimaging. Beyond my own work, I am dedicated to supporting sound methodology broadly at the University of Oregon \u2014 I\u2019m a regular contributor to the department's R Club (a statistical programming consulting and tutorial group), as well as the Bayesian statics seminar.
