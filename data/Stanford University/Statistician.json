Experience Statistician Stanford University School of Medicine October 2012  \u2013 Present (2 years 11 months) Surgery Department I serve as the data analysis resource for the faculty and resident surgeons in the department. Project areas include effectiveness of surgical diagnostic imaging devices, teaching methods for training medical residents, associations between hospital and surgeon procedure volumes with clinical outcomes, and associations between nurse-to-patient ratios and adverse events. Several projects have been presented at conferences, and more abstracts and manuscripts are in progress. Many projects use large national- and state-level Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) data sets.  \n \nI perform analyses in both R and SAS, using SQL to merge and manipulate data. I write reusable functions and macros for data manipulation, model building, and results table formatting. I create clearly written and illustrated reports of analyses and results for non-technical collaborators, and produce statistical analysis and results sections, tables, and figures for abstracts, posters, journal articles. I provide power vs. sample size curves for study planning, and I contribute statistical content to grant proposals. Biostatistician/Bioinformatician Aviir, Inc. September 2010  \u2013  December 2011  (1 year 4 months) My contributions included planning and implementing data analyses for biochemical assay calibration/quality control and large-cohort clinical model validation. I was very productive in building extendable, reusable R codebases for our projects. I cleaned, modularized, and substantially extended previously written code. For a newly added source of lab data, I built from scratch a data cleaning and processing pipeline that included format standardization, data entry error checks, outlier detection, measurement calibration, and process diagnostic graphs. In doing so, I accomodated frequently changing input formats, and implemented custom quality control and calibration procedures that I helped plan, evaluate, and revise.  \n \nI communicated regularly, clearly, and efficiently with my colleagues to coordinate our efforts and answer their questions about our statistical results, and I regularly prepared and gave presentations to the entire R&D team during weekly update meetings. I also contributed to statistical methods sections for operating procedures and technical reports. I continue to consult for Aviir often.
