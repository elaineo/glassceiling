Debian Technical Committee member from January of 2009 to November of 2014. I participate in distribution-wide technical policy and design, and previously made substantial contributions to the Lintian package checking tool. I'm also a member of the Shibboleth, Perl, and NVIDIA packaging teams and assist when I have time. \n \nI also maintain Debian packages of most of the software I personally develop and attempt to assist with various packages I personally use. \n \nAs a member of the Debian Technical Committee, I was part of the group that handles appeals and dispute resolution for technical issues within Debian. I did extensive research and analysis on init systems and was an active participant in Debian's evaluation of systemd, upstart, and other next-generation init systems. Technical Lead Stanford University March 2002  \u2013  August 2014  (12 years 6 months) San Francisco Bay Area Lead systems administrator for the group responsible for campus authentication, directory, email, and distributed file system services for all of Stanford University. Was responsible, at one point or another, for every central service run by the group. \n \nWe adopted a DevOps model for service management before it became popular, after too much first-hand experience with inefficiencies and imbalances in the development hand-off model. Our group was one of the first organizations to deploy Puppet broadly in production, and we worked closely with Luke Kanies on early data model and manifest syntax issues. \n \nLead maintainer and developer of the campus Kerberos infrastructure, including contributing patches to both MIT Kerberos and Heimdal and maintaining KDC plugins for password strength checking and synchronization to Active Directory. Helped design the remctl protocol for simple, secure remote command execution in a Kerberos environment and then developed it into the middleware layer used for many system-to-system links and administrative tools at Stanford University and elsewhere. \n \nBuild engineer and then lead developer of the WebAuth site-wide central web authentication system, on which most web security at Stanford University is based. Desgined and implemented support for multifactor authentication within the WebAuth framework and led the team responsible for deploying mandatory multifactor authentication for the entire Stanford user base. \n \nSuccessfully advocated adoption of Debian as the preferred Linux distribution for central IT services. Took over maintenance and development of Stanford's FAI-based Debian build system and designed our local repository and local packaging policies. Led the effort to package all local tools and locally-developed software as first-class Debian packages for proper integration with the rest of the operating system. Systems Administrator Stanford University April 1997  \u2013  March 2002  (5 years) San Francisco Bay Area Maintained a site-wide software installation for, at varying times, SunOS, Solaris, ULTRIX, AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, Tru64, NeXTSTEP, and Linux. Wrote much of the supporting software to maintain a large-scale software installation of over 500 packages and many architectures in AFS. \n \nMaintained AFS file servers for the campus distributed file system and developed numerous tools and infrastructure to automate common AFS maintenance tasks. Many of those tools are still in use today at Stanford, and some have been adopted more broadly. \n \nDid other software development and systems administration on demand, including maintaining the campus Usenet servers, writing the log rotation and archiving software still in use by Stanford today, and maintaining the Solaris build system.

Technical Lead Stanford University March 2002  \u2013  August 2014  (12 years 6 months) San Francisco Bay Area Lead systems administrator for the group responsible for campus authentication, directory, email, and distributed file system services for all of Stanford University. Was responsible, at one point or another, for every central service run by the group. \n \nWe adopted a DevOps model for service management before it became popular, after too much first-hand experience with inefficiencies and imbalances in the development hand-off model. Our group was one of the first organizations to deploy Puppet broadly in production, and we worked closely with Luke Kanies on early data model and manifest syntax issues. \n \nLead maintainer and developer of the campus Kerberos infrastructure, including contributing patches to both MIT Kerberos and Heimdal and maintaining KDC plugins for password strength checking and synchronization to Active Directory. Helped design the remctl protocol for simple, secure remote command execution in a Kerberos environment and then developed it into the middleware layer used for many system-to-system links and administrative tools at Stanford University and elsewhere. \n \nBuild engineer and then lead developer of the WebAuth site-wide central web authentication system, on which most web security at Stanford University is based. Desgined and implemented support for multifactor authentication within the WebAuth framework and led the team responsible for deploying mandatory multifactor authentication for the entire Stanford user base. \n \nSuccessfully advocated adoption of Debian as the preferred Linux distribution for central IT services. Took over maintenance and development of Stanford's FAI-based Debian build system and designed our local repository and local packaging policies. Led the effort to package all local tools and locally-developed software as first-class Debian packages for proper integration with the rest of the operating system.
