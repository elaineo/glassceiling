Summer Research Scholar SENS Research Foundation June 2014  \u2013  September 2014  (4 months) Mountain View, CA I worked on a project with the LysoSENS team to create a cell model of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) from RNAi-transfected cells for testing of a lysosomal enzyme on rescuing diseased cells. I did tissue culture work with human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) ARPE-19 cells, and I performed western blotting and immunofluorescent staining to compare expression of key AMD and RPE proteins in aged and non-aged cells. I led bi-monthly presentations of the project goals and progress, drafted research reports, and attended and presented a poster at the SRF \u201cRejuvenation Biotechnology\u201d conference in Santa Clara, CA.

Research Assistant Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University June 2013  \u2013  June 2014  (1 year 1 month) Margaret Fuller Lab, Department of Developmental Biology, Stanford University My summer project as a student research assistant was to help on a project investigating the role of alternative polyadenylation of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of RNA in Drosophila spermatocytes and testis stem cells. \n \nExperience with molecular biology lab work (gels, PCR, recombinant plasmid work), fly dissection, fly genetics, and fly maintenance. \n \nMy later work in the lab was to conduct an RNAi screen identifying RNA binding proteins that have functions in spermatogenesis. This research involves dissection, immunofluorescent staining with conjugated antibodies, and learning more about Drosophila genetics to set up crosses. I identified 6 proteins that may have functions in spermatogenesis through binding the 3' UTRs of mRNA in germline stem cells.
