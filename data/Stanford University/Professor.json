Has been involved in identifying neuronal networks that undergo significant degeneration in mouse models of Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Currently, my group is working on the role of norepinephrine-ergic system in failed contextual learning in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome. We are hoping that improving this system would restore cognitive function in children and reduce the severity of Alzheimer pathology in adults with Down syndrome.

So many patients with serious needs - its very rewarding.  \n \nI look forward to continuing to help train Stanford residents and to care for patients returning from Afghanistan within the Palo Alto VA system. \n \nPlastics-Orbit and Neuro-ophthalmology are just the right combination of medicine heavy and medicine not so serious. \n \nI am currently seeing patients in Silicon Valley in Cupertino - Dr. Chase Lay is terrific. I am also pairing with Diane and Balisimo and have launched a medspa on State Street that is great fun. \n \nBut my heart and sole are dedicated to the patients of the central valley with my primary office now in Stockton with the Zeiter Eye Medical Group. \n \nLife is a great journey !
