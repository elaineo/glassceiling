This involves low-level Linux work, including partition management, filesystem creation, GRUB2 configuration, and creation of live CDs to perform hands-off installation. \n \nMy internal manufacturing tool project uses Qt, an off-the-shelf Tek oscilloscope, our proprietary ultrasound generation technology, and a test jig to implement a manufacturing test tool. This tool will automate processes relating to manufacturing our world-class IVUS catheter imaging core. It involves communicating with the scope via USB in Tek's control language from a Qt-based Linux application. This application will improve the workflow of our multiple manufacturing lines, saving time and money. Technologies include simple digital signal analysis, HTML report generation, and state-machines for controlled workflow. This project has been deployed to our remote manufacturing site. \n \nI am currently implementing a C++/Qt project on Windows 7 to perform automatic conversion of proprietary-format data into DICOM-compatible IVUS studies for manipulation by DICOM viewers and import into hospital PACS systems. This application involves both user interaction and background operation. The Qt State Machine framework drives much of its behavior. \n \nI have recently taken over a C- and asm-based embedded project using an Atmel ATxmega processor to precisely control a BLDC motor-controlled linear translation stage for IVUS investigations. I also accured another C/microcontroller-based project for precisely controlling the rotational velocity of the spinning ultrasound core inside our catheter sheath.

I also help debug motor drivers, detect system wiring issues, specify cabling, and install motion systems. \n \nI contributed a multi-threaded, C-based Python wrapper to allow scripts to interact directly with the control system. I wrote a native PyQt library and a QtDesigner plugin in Python so customers could create their own GUIs in QtDesigner. \n \nI work in a cross-functional team, collaborating with mechanical and electrical engineers, technicians, instrument scientists and experimenters. I give user training in how to use my GUI-based monitoring and control system and provide 24-hr. support during critical, must-work commissioning and science data-gathering periods. \n \nI transitioned over to the data acquisition team (DAQ) to work on their high-speed networking (10GbE) projects as well as developing a custom Linux kernel driver for a high-speed position encoder readout board. The encoder readout was used to determine the distance between two objects at the exact instant that a laser wavefront was fired into a chamber. The driver acted as a sensor and fed data into the overall DAQ network. \n \nThe DAQ work was done on RHEL 5.4.

I also help debug motor drivers, detect system wiring issues, specify cabling, and install motion systems. \n \nI contributed a multi-threaded, C-based Python wrapper to allow scripts to interact directly with the control system. I wrote a native PyQt library and a QtDesigner plugin in Python so customers could create their own GUIs in QtDesigner. \n \nI work in a cross-functional team, collaborating with mechanical and electrical engineers, technicians, instrument scientists and experimenters. I give user training in how to use my GUI-based monitoring and control system and provide 24-hr. support during critical, must-work commissioning and science data-gathering periods. \n \nI transitioned over to the data acquisition team (DAQ) to work on their high-speed networking (10GbE) projects as well as developing a custom Linux kernel driver for a high-speed position encoder readout board. The encoder readout was used to determine the distance between two objects at the exact instant that a laser wavefront was fired into a chamber. The driver acted as a sensor and fed data into the overall DAQ network. \n \nThe DAQ work was done on RHEL 5.4.

Sr. Software Engineer St. Jude Medical November 2006  \u2013  October 2008  (2 years) Sole software engineer in the Atrial Fibrillation (AF) division. Authored and responsible for maintenance of wxPython-based in-field firmware updater transferring image files across RS-232. \n \nAlso contributed to maintenance of ARM7-based RF generator application for directing high-intensity ultrasound energy to ablate cardiac tissue and reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation. Application was a bare-metal, OS-less design originally implemented by contract design firm. \n \nInitiated project to re-implement RF generator application with totally new hardware and software platform. The hardware reproduced the functionality of the previous device but used off-the-shelf components instead of custom FPGAs. Fitted an off-the-shelf UML (executable UML, xtUML) architecture developed by Andrew Mangogna for use on my platform.
