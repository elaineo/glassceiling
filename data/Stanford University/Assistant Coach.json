I earned it as part of a small team of people who helped make the launch and early on-orbit testing phase of a satellite work seamlessly. Employee of the Month Lockheed Martin August 2007 Awarded employee of the month on the SBIRS program for my work in getting software tools working, prepped and officially certified for use for an upcoming satellite launch. NASA Space Grant Scholarship NASA Space Grant September 2000 Awarded a half-tuition scholarship by the NASA Space Grant Foundation for aspiring students in engineering fields. I was very lucky to receive this award, as it made the otherwise unaffordable school possible, and the grant program connected me with a group of scholars and periodically checked in on my progress. Their support contributed to my success and I appreciate it to this day. Unit Member of the Year Air National Guard December 2003 Awarded member of the year for my unit (560th AF Band).
