The most gratifying aspect of my work is coaching students on communicating their research projects and personal stories so they can powerfully engage with the broader public. I write and edit across multiple platforms, and advise students and faculty on communications strategy and media relations. I am proficient in Drupal and HTML, and have experience in website content management, database management, digital photo editing, and social justice grantmaking. \n \nSome topics I have covered include: girls' schooling in Turkey, culturally sensitive HIV education in India, the Preschool for All initiative, youth arts activism in the Bay Area, and Northern Cheyenne resistance to methane development in Montana. Writing areas of interest: K-12 and higher education, arts-based youth development, community health, and environmental justice.
