It's a trick question. You can't be certain of a brain's gender just by looking at its external features.

Every year, I look forward to opportunities, such as Brain Day, where I can communicate my enthusiasm for and knowledge of neuroscience to the broader community.  \n \nI am an inquisitive scientist seeking a research or support position in the Bay Area. \n \nBeyond communication between people, I'm also interested in communication within people. Our cells are constantly talking to one another to maintain our body temperature, recognize the voices of our loved ones, or calculate the tip for lunch. As an undergraduate student, I studied communication of circadian signals between neurons and helped identify a new potential treatment for jet-lag.
