The genes in this pathway may also be mutated or function poorly in human patients with type 2 and gestational diabetes, and a careful assessment of this pathway\u2019s function in patients may be a useful for identifying those at high risk for developing diabetes. Additionally, we have demonstrated that this pathway can lead to increased expression of many hallmark diabetes genes, including insulin. These results suggest that increasing this pathway\u2019s function through pharmacological or other means might provide a novel therapy for the treatment of diabetes. da Vinci Community Visiting Scholar Santa Clara University March 2005  \u2013  May 2005  (3 months) I advised undergraduates interested in medical and graduate school as a live-in scholar at Santa Clara University.

However, the signal pathways that govern facultative proliferation and compensatory gene expression in \u00df-cells are not well understood. I demonstrated that calcineurin and its target Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) control \u00df-cell proliferation and insulin production in vivo. Mice with \u00df-cell-specific conditional deletion of Calcineurin b1 (\u00dfCnb1KO mice) developed age-dependent diabetes. In contrast, conditional activation of NFATc1 in adult \u00df-cells increased proliferation and \u00df-cell mass and directly stimulated expression of insulin and other \u00df-cell factors. Expression of activated NFATc1 in the \u00df-cells of \u00dfCnb1KO mice rescued diabetes mellitus and restored serum insulin levels. Thus, loss- and gain-of-function studies show that calcineurin/NFAT signaling in vivo is crucial for maintaining growth and crucial endocrine functions of pancreatic \u00df-cells.

Knight Journalism Fellow at Stanford University, one of 20 domestic and international fellows, I focus on how to improve media service and infrastructure in undeserved and low-income communities.  \n \nI have been a professional journalist and writer for 23 years. I started my career in 1992 at The Tenderloin Times, a newspaper founded by homeless men in San Francisco's central city. Since then, and before joining The Press Democrat in 2001, my work included stints as a reporter and then the editor at the St. Helena Star weekly; a regular contributor to Wired Magazine; a contributing editor to Wine Business Monthly; and a contributor to The Sonoma County Independent, the San Diego Union Tribune, and Gauntlet Magazine, a journal devoted to free speech issues.  \n \nIn 2007 and 2008, I took a sabbatical and worked at National Public Radio member station KRCB in Sonoma County, where I was editorial coordinator for Voice of Youth, a teaching project focused mainly on at-risk youth. We produced stories for a bi-weekly, bilingual radio show, learned stuff about each other and had lots of fun. \n \nMy work has been recognized with multiple prizes including the George Polk Regional Reporting award (shared), a Best of the West Explanatory Reporting award and two Associated Press Fairbanks Public Service awards.

Knight Journalism Fellow Stanford University August 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 1 month) Stanford University Researching news coverage of low-income communities in the United States and launching a digital news outlet in East Palo Alto, the poorest and most diverse city in Silicon Valley. Staff Writer The Press Democrat December 2001  \u2013  May 2014  (12 years 6 months) As a reporter at this Pulitzer Prize-wining New York Times Regional newspaper, I have covered crime and gangs, courts, social welfare issues, government, politics and business. I develop frequent short- and long-term enterprise reporting initiatives, and am regularly assigned to special projects. I was a lead reporter on a project about globalization\u2019s impacts that won a George Polk Award. Editorial Director, Voice of Youth KRCB Radio and Television 2007  \u2013  2008  (1 year) Worked with up to a dozen at-risk youth to harness their creative talents and energies to produce radio stories for a local and national audience. Writer Freelance Journalist 1999  \u2013  2002  (3 years) \u2022 Wired Magazine: \nI was a regular contributor to this Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine, covering subjects including artificial intelligence, Microsoft, supercomputing and venture capitalists for the magazine\u2019s Must Read news section. \n \n\u2022 Northern California Bohemian: \nA frequent contributor to this award-winning weekly newspaper, I wrote cover stories on farmworker housing and urban growth issues, among other subjects. \n \n\u2022 Wine Business Monthly: \nAs a contributing editor to this national wine industry trade magazine, I wrote feature articles on subjects including winemaking techniques, wine futures markets and quality control issues. Reporter and Editor St. Helena Star 1995  \u2013  1998  (3 years) As editor of this weekly newspaper (where I was a reporter from 1993-1994), I supervised a staff of eight, directed news coverage, produced four special editions annually, edited the work of four reporters and covered general assignment news. Under my editorship, The Star\u2019s circulation and advertising lineage increased, and the newspaper received eight editorial content awards from the California Newspaper Publishers Association. Reporter and Editor The Tenderloin Times 1992  \u2013  1994  (2 years) As a reporter for this trilingual inner-city newspaper, I covered City Hall, redevelopment and poverty issues, and assisted on the paper\u2019s annual census of homeless deaths in the city. As editor of the English section, I coordinated freelance contributors, designed and laid out pages and worked closely with the Vietnamese and Khmer language section editors to coordinate content. I also helped deliver the newspaper. John S.

Experience Postdoctoral Fellow Stanford University August 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 1 month) Stanford, California I am researching the mechanisms of tumor evolution in response to targeted therapies, using basal cell carcinoma and the Hedgehog pathway as a model. Experience in whole exome and targeted sequencing analysis, ATAC seq, confocal microscopy, cell culture and animal models of cancer. Postdoctoral Fellow Goga Lab, Hematology/ Oncology UCSF September 2013  \u2013  July 2014  (11 months) San Francisco Continuation of my graduate studies, determining the effect of CDK1 inhibition on human and mouse embryonic stem cells. Graduate Student Goga Lab, Hematology/Oncology UCSF 2007  \u2013  May 2013  (6 years) San Francisco My thesis research focused on synthetically lethal approaches to induce apoptosis in embryonic stem cells as well as triple negative breast cancer cells, through targeting the cell cycle regulatory proteins. Additionally I developed and characterized analog sensitive transgenic mouse models to study the acute inhibition of cell cycle proteins, CDK1 and CDK2. Instructor UCSF school of Medicine March 2012  \u2013  March 2013  (1 year 1 month) UCSF Led peer facilitated discussion groups for medical students.
