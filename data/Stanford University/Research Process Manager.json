RPMs provide compliance oversight of federal regulations and confirm that sponsored projects in the School of Medicine can withstand Congressional review, federal audits, and public scrutiny on the use of taxpayer support. In General the RPM operates under a two tier program (a junior level and senior level) upon which varying responsibilities are placed. The senior level RPM has met all requirements of the Junior level RPM, has passed Certification levels I and II, has been granted full signature authority by the Office of Research Administration for all grant proposal types and grant awards, and now operates independently to provide consultation to the PI and/or staff to ensure that sponsored research funds are managed and expended in compliance with internal and external policies and consequently, continues as the institutional representative throughout the life of the award. The RPM promotes a collaborative model of stewardship among faculty and staff and is an advocate for a responsive, effective research administration process. Reporting to one of the Team Managers and partnering with faculty and staff, the RPM directs and manages the proposal process to ensure timely, compliant and accurate submissions. This process includes: budget development, interpretation of sponsor requirements for both contracts and grants, recommendations to the PI regarding best practices for gathering content to be included in the proposal package, as well as final approval and sign-off (signature authority) before submission. As a representative of Stanford University, an RPM\u2019s signature ensures the proposal meets sponsor, University, and School pre-and post-award guidelines and regulations.
