As a researcher, I have used biochemistry and genetics to explore the function of protein complexes that regulate DNA accessibility and repair. As an educator and mentor, I strive to devise ways of conveying science using multiple learning strategies (e.g. problem-based learning), as well as invest in student professional development by helping them identify and effectively utilize resources that will assist them in their chosen career path.
