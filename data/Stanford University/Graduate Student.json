Experience Postdoctoral Research Scholar Berkeley Seismological Laboratory September 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year) For my postdoctoral research at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory, I am exploring ways to improve the ElarmS earthquake early warning algorithm and methodology. I am particularly interested in using the frequency content soon after a trigger to determine whether or not the trigger was due to a local earthquake. Graduate Student Stanford University July 2008  \u2013  August 2014  (6 years 2 months) Stanford, CA While at Stanford University, I expanded the network by leading teams to install hundreds of sensors in Chile, New Zealand, Mexico, and the San Francisco Bay Area. I then used the data to explore the rapid earthquake detection capabilities of the network. I also explored the use of MEMS sensors and the QCN network in determining the response of a building. The resolution of the sensors at the time was too low to calculate a good response, but the technology proved promising. QCN is also an excellent tool for teaching people of all ages about earthquakes and the physics of motion. Staff Research Associate Berkeley Seismological Lab June 2007  \u2013  July 2008  (1 year 2 months) Berkeley, CA Investigated the rupture process of a sequence of repeating Mw2.1 earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault in Parkfield, CA.

I earned a B.S. in Engineering Mechanics from the University of Illinois with a minor in Computer Science and certificate in Technology Commercialization. I have a strong interest in entrepreneurship, and hope to use graduate study not only to explore research careers, but also opportunities with start-up and early stage companies working at the leading edge of technology. The summer of 2013 I worked as a volunteer intern with Bump Nonprofit Design Studio, a Champaign-Urbana based start-up currently focused on development of the OpenSocket, which is a universal fit prosthetic arm accessible to amputees in developing countries due to its extremely low cost. \n \nAs an undergraduate student, I served as president of Illini Pride Student Athletic Board, a 3,600 member organization that includes the Block I, Orange Krush, and other student support groups for Illinois' athletic programs. With a long-time friend, I co-founded and ran HigherMed, Inc., a company whose goal was to design an easier-to-use pill-dispensing prescription bottle cap. Our start-up placed 2nd in the 2012 Cozad New Venture Competition at UIUC. I also enjoy music, particularly classical solo and choral works, and have performed as a baritone soloist or chorus member with a number of Champaign-Urbana groups including the Baroque Artists of Champaign-Urbana and the Champaign Symphony Orchestra. In addition, I've had the opportunity to perform the Star-Spangled Banner at Chicago Bulls, Chicago White Sox, and numerous Illinois athletic events.

Working in a team of 5 students, we investigated the feasibility of moving from in-house molding of polymer parts to various commercial processes such as injection molding, thermoforming, and so on. The team also investigated the strength properties of the product both before and after several design revisions that would be integral to this manufacturing change. \n \nAfter the conclusion of the senior design project, I've continued to work with Bump over the summer as a volunteer intern. Projects include updating flat CAD template models for use in a water jet and re-design of in-house wooden molds.
