Experience Biostatistician Stanford University School of Medicine, Quantitative Sciences Unit June 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 3 months) I provide statistical support on all phases of research to principal investigators in the Stanford University School of Medicine. Areas of research have included oncology, nutrition, preventative health, infectious diseases, and cardiovascular disease. In these collaborations, I provide advice on study design, statistical analysis, and interpretation of results and perform statistical analysis for a variety of observational and experimental studies. I have served as a mentor for the Stanford Intensive Course in Clinical Research. Additionally, I collaborate on original research in applied statistics, currently focused on evaluating and extending imputation methods for longitudinal data with missing data in both time-varying and fixed correlated covariates. Biostatistician Stanford University School of Medicine, Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care June 2013  \u2013  June 2014  (1 year 1 month) I was the sole statistician for the research lab of Dr. Nayer Khazeni. I directly collaborated with the principal investigator to conduct epidemiologic and experimental studies on topics including pandemic influenza (A) H5N1 and psychological determinants of health and health behavior. Primary responsibilities included formulating scientific questions, developing statistical analysis strategies, designing experimental and observational studies, preparing statistical graphics for scientific manuscripts, and writing manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals. Independent Statistics Consultant Self-employed June 2013  \u2013  June 2014  (1 year 1 month) I provide as-needed statistical consulting on a variety of projects. Tasks have included providing custom power analysis simulations and statistical feedback on NIH grant proposals, addressing criticism by statistical reviewers, and performing style editing on translated statistics manuscripts.

My recent interest is angled towards methodologies for clinical trial designs with biomarkers. I am also interested in precision medicine: how to mine and create predictive models from large-scale healthcare data including electronic medical records and genomics and how to utilize the model in and validate the model with controlled studies such as clinical trials.
