Experience PhD Candidate Stanford University June 2011  \u2013 Present (4 years 3 months) Research advised by Professor Allison Okamura. Funding through an NRI-Large collaborative research grant entitled, \"Multilateral Manipulation by Human-Robot Collaborative Systems\". Multilateral manipulation is when a human operator controls one or more robot manipulators in partnership with one or more controllers. My research focuses on surgical applications of this human-centered autonomy. Completed work includes design of a software framework capable of supporting numerous collaboration strategies between a human and autonomous agent.  \n \nThis framework's first extension was to an inclusion segmentation task. Examples of collaboration strategies implemented include a fully autonomous algorithm, whereby numerous machine learning algorithms localize the hard inclusion, to supervised control, to pure teleoperation, shared control, and traded control. Results indicated tradeoffs in sensitivity, specificity, duration of experiment, and safety implications. This work used commercial Phantom haptic devices (Geomagic, Morrisville, NC, USA).  \n \nMost recently this work has been extended to a debridement task implemented on the RAVEN surgical platform (Applied Dexterity, Seattle, WA, USA) . Current work combines the surgical sub-tasks already investigated into an entire surgical procedure, whereby under a variety of collaboration models a human and a robotic agent can explore an artificial tissue for hard inclusions, cut its skin, and excise any hard inclusions detected. I am implementing this task on the da Vinci Research Kit (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Navigation Intern Intuitive Surgical June 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 3 months) Working in the emerging technologies division.

Senior Economic Advisor House of Commons September 2011  \u2013  December 2011  (4 months) London, United Kingdom I advised a senior Member of Parliament on macroeconomics, fiscal and monetary policy, and supported the Member in their work on the Treasury Select Committee and the Draft Financial Services Bill Joint Committee. \n \nI also drafted articles for the national press, wrote speeches, and liaised with economic policymakers, think tanks and journalists in the UK and abroad.

I performed detailed research in academic business journals and books, conducted focus groups with employees throughout the organisation, and undertook quantitative and qualitative studies of internal behaviours, policies and communications, to develop a comprehensive assessment and set of recommendations for the Department. I secured a personal endorsement of my work from the Secretary of State, and the presentation I created and delivered to my manager was so compelling that I was invited to repeat it for the Division's Executive Team, and subsequently for the Finance Director General. \n \nI also used my position within government to secure a large number of individual meetings with senior civil servants and government ministers working in my fields of interest. In particular, I spent days shadowing people as diverse as the Prime Minister's Chief Economic Adviser and Lord Freud, the Minister for Welfare Reform, and arranged one-on-one meetings with the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff, the Prime Minister's Head of Afghanistan Comms, the FCO's lead on the SDSR, the Permanent Secretary at HM Treasury, and many others - as well as an entire afternoon with Sir Gus O'Donnell, Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Civil Service.

South Asia Correspondent The Economist September 2009  \u2013  March 2010  (7 months) In September 2009 I travelled to Afghanistan and the tribal areas of Pakistan as a freelance correspondent. \n \nBefore my trip, I negotiated a place on a \"Surviving Hostile Regions\" course, run by SAS soldiers for BBC journalists and FCO officials, for which I gained a BTEC Level 4 professional qualification. I also spent time studying one of the local languages, Dari, and arranged to stay with an Afghan family in London to improve my conversation skills and cultural awareness. \n \nIn country, I met with everyone from Taliban students at a madrassa to senior ISAF commanders and UN diplomats. \n \nI wrote a three part series on Afghanistan and Pakistan for The Economist, which was published in March 2010. \n \nSubsequently, I was invited to advise British Military Intelligence in a formal capacity.

Broadcast Journalism Intern BBC August 2006  \u2013  August 2006  (1 month) I worked in the BBC's Midlands Today studios, researching stories, observing editorial meetings, and assisting on shoots and live broadcasts.

Experience Research Coordinator, \"Design-X Resilience\" Center for Design Research | Stanford University September 2013  \u2013 Present (2 years) Palo Alto CA \"Design-X Resilience\"\u200b is an initiative dedicated to design problems whose solutions operate in unforeseeable future contexts different from those in which they were originally designed. These future contexts are proving to be behaviorally unpredictable and oftentimes introduce a failure to a design solution. By examining the relationships between context-specific design solutions and the volatile contexts in which they operate, we find a new opportunity for user-centered research and design. \n \nAn interest in Resilience accepts the possibility of failure, which requires an intellectual expansion for a professional community that has for decades designed for Robustness. Historically, robust solutions have required operational persistence in the face of any failure mode, as failure would reflect poorly on the engineered solution, the engineering service delivered, and the engineers themselves. The qualities of strength, durability, and the ability to resist all opposing forces are by themselves no longer of exclusive importance. Today, the qualities of absorption, adaptability, operational dexterity and redundancy are of primary importance. \n \nResilience empowers solutions to return to normalized levels of performance after experiencing failure. Resilient design incorporates feature sets that anticipate future failure, and possess inherent qualities that accelerate recovery.
