PhD Candidate in Ecology Stanford University September 2007  \u2013  March 2013  (5 years 7 months) Dissertation research focused on microbial community ecology at the landscape scale using next-generation sequencing techniques - specifically with an interest in understanding how symbiotic organisms shape their hosts' function in ecosystems. Tutor Stutors November 2008  \u2013  June 2010  (1 year 8 months) Tutored elementary to college students in a range of subjects (Math, English, Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science), writing skills, and test prep (SSAT/ISEE, CSU Writing Proficiency Exam, SAT, SAT II, ACT, APs, GRE). Teacher IBS Academy August 2006  \u2013  August 2007  (1 year 1 month) Taught a variety of AP subjects (Macro/Micro Economics, Biology, Chemistry, Calculus) and test preparation (AP, SAT I/II, GRE, TOEFL) at a private academy in Seoul, South Korea. Research Technician Harvard University September 2005  \u2013  July 2006  (11 months) Technician in the Schrag Geochemical Oceanography Lab working on past climate reconstruction using isotopic techniques. Research Intern USDA Forest Service 2003  \u2013  2005  (2 years) Conducted field ecology research on community vegetation ecology, succession, and invasive species - with a focus on lowland wet forests and the invasive tree Psidium cattleianum (strawberry guava).
