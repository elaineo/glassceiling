Scientific research and commitment to leadership are my answers. \n \nEnergy is the most important challenge of the next century. I am interested in energy efficiency and new approaches to enable competitive renewable energy sources. In my research, I work with light and matter. I create semiconductor nanostructures specifically designed to be efficient light sources; on a different side, I manipulate and trap light to envision next generation of silicon-based solar cells. I am a physicist by training (PhD in 2010). Right now, my research activity is across physics, materials science, and engineering. The perfect balance between fundamental concepts applied to real devices. I always had a strong interaction with semiconductor industries. I have large experience and ability to design, fabricate and test new materials and device prototypes, developing a new idea from the basic physical principles to an actual implementation. \n \nI am aware that innovation can be made only by a diverse team of people focused on the same goal.

I hold my current position also because of my education. This is because I decided to get involved in my alma mater alumni association. This really is a rewarding experience in terms of positive feedbacks, satisfactions for all the organized events, and recognition from the current students.  \n \n \nWho we are \n \n130+ alumni of a high-excellence education institution within the University of Catania (Scuola Superiore di Catania). The institution acceptance rate is very low (less than 10%). It provides a full scholarship for all the college years, including lodging in an historical campus (Villa San Saverio). Very high grade average and strict deadlines are required to maintain the scholarship. Attendance of complementary and high-level classes is required, along with a research thesis at the end of the scholarship (in addition to the standard university classes and master thesis). As alumni, we contribute to the education of the current students, create a network of diverse experiences and skills, represent the best output of our alma mater. \n \n \nWhat we do \n \nWe organize scientific seminars and conferences (once a week during the school year) and orientation activities. We mentor current students. We organize social events. \n \n \nMy role and responsibilities \n \nAs a President, I run and lead the organization of all the events and activities; I interact with the academic and students representatives; I organize an yearly fund-raising campaign to support the Association activities; I interact with all the alumni members to involve, motivate, and support their active participation; I am the administrator of the Association website, Facebook and LinkedIn groups, Twitter and YouTube accounts. Chief Organizer TEDxSSC April 2014  \u2013  October 2014  (7 months) TEDxSSC - Dall'eccezione alla regola (From the exception to the rule) \n \nLeading the entire organization of a TEDx event (100+ guests, 20+ speakers, 18 organizing \nteam members, $20k budget). \n \nTED is a world-wide recognized brand ensuring high quality talks, speakers and ideas. As a President of the SSC Alumni Association, along with the Student Association and the academic leaders, we decided to bring TED experience in our institution and community through TEDxSSC. In fact, many of the TEDx values match our institution values (interdisciplinarity, fostering new ideas, spreading innovation and creativity). TEDx mission is to communicate the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world. We want to demonstrate how uncommon ideas and people (the exceptions) can make a real difference, change the world and set a new standard for our everyday life. We have chosen an extremely fascinating theme: \u201cDall\u2019eccezione alla regola\u201d (\u201cFrom the exception to the standard\u201d). Our speakers will be unheard local voices as well as known personalities. We will select our list of speakers choosing those people that can tell their personal story as an example of something first considered an exception, then becoming a new standard. iFarm Team program volunteer Stanford University Office of Technology Licensing January 2014  \u2013  June 2014  (6 months) Moving technology form the research lab to everyday life. This is my goal. \n \nI was admitted in the Stanford iFarm program during Winter 2014. The Stanford Innovation Farm Teams Project seeks to improve success and overall efficiency of the commercialization of Stanford-owned inventions while providing an educational experience to iFarm Team participants. Participation in the iFarm Team Project provides individuals with a unique educational experience and opportunity to network in highly competitive industries. Together with my other teammates, we will select one of the Stanford-owned technology and move it to a commercialization stage.

As a President of the SSC Alumni Association, along with the Student Association and the academic leaders, we decided to bring TED experience in our institution and community through TEDxSSC. In fact, many of the TEDx values match our institution values (interdisciplinarity, fostering new ideas, spreading innovation and creativity). TEDx mission is to communicate the power of ideas to change attitudes, lives and, ultimately, the world. We want to demonstrate how uncommon ideas and people (the exceptions) can make a real difference, change the world and set a new standard for our everyday life. We have chosen an extremely fascinating theme: \u201cDall\u2019eccezione alla regola\u201d (\u201cFrom the exception to the standard\u201d). Our speakers will be unheard local voices as well as known personalities. We will select our list of speakers choosing those people that can tell their personal story as an example of something first considered an exception, then becoming a new standard.

Domenico Pacifici Honors & Awards ", "Experience Postdoctoral Scholar Stanford University April 2007  \u2013  October 2010  (3 years 7 months) I am a postdoctoral scholar studying neuroscience at Stanford University. I am working in Tirin Moore's laboratory studying the neural basis of vison. I use a combination of physiological and computational techniques to investigate how neurons in the brain encode information about visual world that can be used to guide behavior. Currently my focus is on understanding how neurons in frontal cortex (a region of the brain critical for complex cognitive functioning) can integrate visual information over time to create the persistent internal representations required for goal-driven behaviors. This work lies at the intersection of sensory processing and memory, two functions that are most often studied in isolation, despite the fact that in daily life they are often intertwined. Laboratory Instructor Princeton University January 2003  \u2013  May 2003  (5 months) Led a weekly lab section for an undergraduate course on cognitive neuroscience. Activities included giving brief presentations on relevant course material, answering student questions, leading experimental exercises in neuroanatomy and perception, and editing and grading student term papers. Software Design Engineer Intern Microsoft - Macintosh Power Point Division June 2000  \u2013  August 2000  (3 months) During my time at Microsoft I developed a \"print preview\" capability for a program that integrated several features of Power Point into a software package for graphics design and illustration. I used CodeWarrior development tools to design and test my project, which was created in C++. Teaching Assistant - Introduction to Computing University of Michigan College of Engineering August 1999  \u2013  December 1999  (5 months) Led a weekly discussion section for an introductory electrical engineering and computer science class. Course material covered fundamentals of digital representations, computer architecture and assembly coding, and C programming. Activities included designing and giving presentations to summarize the week's lectures and to give added emphasis to important concepts, to address student questions, provide consultation on problem sets, and prepare and lead review sessions before exams. Web Development Assistant University of Michigan Hospitals - Radiation Oncology May 1999  \u2013  August 1999  (4 months) Developed a web site that allowed doctors to securely access a database of patient scheduling information remotely. Self-taught web page development including HTML and server-side scripting using Microsoft Active Server Pages.
