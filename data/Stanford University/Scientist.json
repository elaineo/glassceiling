Experience Senior Research Scientist Stanford University School of Medicine January 2005  \u2013 Present (10 years 8 months) Senior Reserach Scientist Stanford University 2005  \u2013 Present (10 years) Genome Wide association studies for loci involved in Narcolepsy and Kleine Levin Syndrome disease susceptibility, and sleep traits. Including data prep/curation, imputation, statistical analysis. Platforms: Affymetrix 500K set, Affy 6.0, Illumina ImmunoChip. \n \nHeavy participation in preparation of manuscripts and grant submissions from our lab. Notable expertise in scientific writing. \n \nGeneral Expert-Doc-Friday help when a good brain and very little direction are required in a hurry. Post Doctoral Fellow/ Research Associate Stanford Center for Narcolepsy January 1996  \u2013  2005  (9 years) Palo Alto California In my initial postdoc project, I used a novel genome-jumping strategy based on conserved synteny to identify new BAC clone seeds to cover the emerging critical region in canine narcolepsy. Methods included pre-genome era bioinformatics to identify human clones for use in cross species hybridization of a canine genome library. This was followed by cytogenetic analysis to determine whether the identified clones were in the critical region, as well is interphase FISH to determine relative position. BAC clones were then turned into plasmid libraries to develop genetic markers for linkage/finemapping, chromosome walking to extend and merge contigs, and serve as sources for other potential human-canine seed development.  \n \nSecond Post doc project focused on mutational analysis of hypocretin related genes in typical/ sporadic and unusual cases of narcolepsy which would more likely harbor mutations. Identified the only hypocretin mutation known, causing onset at 6 months. Functional analysis of identified mutation, showing abnormal trafficking/ impact on cells.  \n \nFollowing these, I participated in the development of our zebrafish research projects, primarily focusing on identification, cloning and expression characterization of known sleep-related genes in the zebrafish. Creation of transgenic GFP fish lines. Promoter analysis of zebrafish hypocretin gene. Graduate Student Dept.
