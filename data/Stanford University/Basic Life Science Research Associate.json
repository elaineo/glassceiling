Contributed to the development and reproducibility of a high-throughput matrix assay used to identify specific epitopes from novel and published PDZ interactions. Scientific Head of Rheumatoid Arthritis Group Anergen Inc. December 1995  \u2013  1998  (3 years) Lead scientist and acting project manager for corporate client project. Investigated the disease-associated, auto-antigenic immune response to MHC-based therapeutics designed for the treatment of autoimmune disease. Generated disease-associated, antigen-specific T cell clones from patient PBL to demonstrate T cell anergy with soluble MHC:peptide complex and developed cell-based potency assays using T cell hybridomas. Contributed to the design of a modified ELISPOT assay for the detection of low-frequency human T cells. Obtained IRB approval and contributed to the successful filing of an IND and initiation of a Phase I Clinical Trial. Scientific Head of Rheumatoid Arthritis Group Anergen Inc.

Post-Doctoral Research Stanford University January 1992  \u2013  December 1995  (4 years) Studied the in vitro and in vivo influence of MHC class II polymorphism on the immune response. Compared the effects of MHC class II allelic differences on T cell presentation and peptide binding resulting in the identification of the critical MHC class II pocket and peptide reside responsible for allelic differences. Initiated a collaboration and supplied the functional testing to validate a molecular model for I-Ak and I-Au:myelin basic protein complexes. Demonstrated differences in immune recognition of myelin basic protein-immunized congenic animals expressing identical MHC molecules, observations spawned a graduate student project.
