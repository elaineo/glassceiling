Patterned using electron-beam lithography, all artificial spin ices are patterned thin films with an imposed geometry that introduces magnetic frustration of the magnetic spins. The dimensions of the elements require them to be single magnetic domains. Furthermore, the small dimensions impose a strong shape anisotropy, and this has the effect of forcing the magnetic spins of the individual elements to point along the elements\u2019 longitudinal axis.
