Statisitician and Process Control Engineer. Genentech May 2011  \u2013  December 2012  (1 year 8 months) Portland, Oregon Area Automate and acquire production data for the purpose of establishing product action limits, identify cause and effect factors, establish actions and timelines to resolve causes of variability. Created software to transfer coded data from the manufacturing inspection equipment into a database. This enable detailed and frequent analysis of production data to ensure all aspects of the inspection tool were operating properly. \nDocument Monthly, Quarterly and Annual product production quality performance reports for management and cross site review. Identified 3 manufacturing concerns which resulted in changes that had a positive impact on production quality and output. Statisitician and Process Control Engineer.
