Using Java Standard Edition SDK and the Eclipse IDE, students will learn application development using the Java framework. Lectures and code examples are reinforced with hands-on labs, assignments, and online work outside of class. Topics include, core graphics, event handling, and Swing to provide an understanding of how to build graphical user interfaces using JavaBean design principles and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. Additional topics include: packages, inner classes, file i/o, an overview of Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), an introduction to network programming, and an introduction to multi-threaded programming. Students will use the Java standard coding style and naming conventions to build and deploy stand alone applications. For those who want preparation for an industry certification, much of this material is also on the Oracle Java Programmer exam, which is available via a 3rd party at additional cost.
