As product owner my responsibilities include: \n- Developing a vision for the product and communicating and upholding that vision \n- Ensuring delivery of prioritised, valuable functionality that meets the business need \n- Having a long term view of evolution of the product and ensure current work contributes to that view \n- Balancing the need for quick delivery of new functionality with the need to address technical debt \n \nAs the lead engineer within the team I play a key role in helping estimate and break down stories for the team as well as coding key parts of the product. \n \n\u00b7 Prior to that I worked for four years as a Senior Engineer within the Strategic Projects team, working on primarily on Proof Of Concept and/or strategic collaborations with key IOT Solution Providers, Telecommunication Equipment Providers, Network Operators and Standards Bodies. \n\u00b7 These projects often involve stretching/enhancing the existing company product set in new and challenging areas prior to a full commercialization effort by the Road Map team. \n\u00b7 For each project, I played a key role in developing strong relationships with our customers which lead to effective communication between parties allowing for successful results in each case. In many of the projects I was the lead developer, responsible for estimating and designing the solutions as well as the development of key parts of the implementation. These products were typically written in Java using OSGi, Hibernate, Spring and Camel. In addition to that key libraries such as Atmosphere were evaluated and incorporated into the platforms to meet specific needs not present in the core product. \n\u00b7 I represented Aepona at Mobile World Congress 2012 providing technical demonstrations. I also initiated the internal Maker group and was the company's representative to Farset Labs in 2014. Software Developer BTI Photonic Systems March 2009  \u2013  March 2010  (1 year 1 month) \u00b7 Developer of the Ethernet Services functionality within the proNX900 NMS product for the packetVX and 700 series switches. Swing based GUIs, interacting with various service and domain layers, communicated to the switches through an SNMP interface. For the 700 series switches, a thicker business layer was introduced within the proNX900 in order to match functionality provided on the packetVX switch. \n\u00b7 Both projects involved requirements review, analysis and design of the features before implementation and integration of the software with the hardware deliverables. In addition to this I also mentored a number of other team members in various aspects of the project. Senior Software Engineer Liberty Mutual (Liberty I.T.) January 2008  \u2013  March 2009  (1 year 3 months) \u00b7 Played key role in a number of high profile projects. \n\u00b7 Held the role of Technical Lead which involved analyzing and designing architectural changes for upcoming releases; providing estimates of work for business requests; interfacing with in house back-end teams and 3rd party vendors to reach agreement on complex design considerations; assisting less experienced team members and ensuring their continued development through the project lifecycle. \n\u00b7 Responsible for the reintroduction of daily SCRUM sessions to ensure defects encountered during design phase were picked up and evenly distributed throughout the team. This led to improved turn-around times, better communication and project understanding within the team. Software Engineer Liberty Mutual (Liberty I.T.) July 2004  \u2013  December 2007  (3 years 6 months) \u00b7 Using Test Driven Development, I participated in the development of an online document management system for an International Underwriting team. \n\u00b7 Participated in vendor selection review of a number of competitors to determine suitable replacement for legacy systems. \n\u00b7 Assisted in the development of a large J2EE application which allowed both call centre and internet users to generate and produce both automobile and property insurance business throughout the United States. A significant part of this was carrying out requirements reviews, estimation and analysis for any changes being proposed by the business users. \n\u00b7 Assumed one of the lead roles in the development of a Watir test framework to ensure thorough integration testing was carried out for large number of deliverables under very tight time constraints. As no training was available at the time in Belfast for Ruby/Watir development, key skills were acquired through reading online documentation and other literature. \n\u00b7 Performed role as CVS administration for a number of projects and instigated a number of key process improvements in order to overcome shortcomings with toolset. This led to reduced time spent by developers performing a merge and broke an existing dependency on local merge history on a \u201cBranch Managers\u201d machine, ultimately allowing the role of branch manager to be rotated within a team. Software Engineer Ericsson Systems Expertise, Athlone June 1998  \u2013  July 2004  (6 years 2 months) \u00b7 Provided object-oriented design and development of n-tiered telecoms management systems, written in Erlang and later Java. These distributed applications used various methods of communication between the client and server, including CORBA, RMI SNMP, and OTP. \n\u00b7 Applications included hardware control systems for local exchanges through to a Job Manager tool that allowed telecom engineers script, schedule, and link tasks which could be deployed and run across a heterogeneous network through various means including telnet and ftp. \n\u00b7 For the java based applications, data was stored in a Sybase database and unit testing was written using the JUnit libraries. \n\u00b7 Performed detailed reviews of product requirements, leading to analysis and design and detailed cost estimation. Also provided critical analysis and input to user documentation for deployed applications. \n\u00b7 Spent three months in Stockholm in a trouble shooting role, triaging software issues on site when applications were being deployed and tested in Unit Acceptance Test Labs. \n\u00b7 Mentored a number of new starts and headed up the development team through the test maintenance cycle.
