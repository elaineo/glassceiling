Cisco, Huawei, Alcatel, etc.). These niche-processors were multi-core and hardware multi-threaded at a time when most mainstream CPUs were single core, and my work focused on the implementation and debug of highly-parallel packet processing algorithms in tight embedded environments (no operating system, just programming the raw RISC cores) to deliver the highest performance possible.  \n \nAs an expert in IXP Microengine programming, I traveled around the US and Europe to help make sales or debug tough customer issues; the aim was always to remove all technical bottlenecks to revenue.  \n \nDesigned and taught advanced technical training programs for internal and external audiences through customer consultation and hands-on learning. These events include low-key internal \"brown bag\" sessions, multi-day bootcamp training for sw engineers, and large, high-profile conferences like the Intel Developer Forum.
