", "Summary Ken Miller, author of \"We don't make Widgets\" compares government processes as a set of pipes that are kinkedup, contorted and a twisted mess. If that is the case, I am a plumber who can help eliminate blockages, straighten the pipes and increase the flow. I primarily use my knowledge of Lean and Six Sigma to facilitate workgroups to find solutions to their process problems, sometimes creating an entire new process. I use technology in it's simplest forms as tools and look at the space \"between the work\" to find ways to decrease throughput time and find gains in capacity. \n \nI've worked in both private industry and government. In 2009 transferred my knowledge of Lean to Government, as I have worked with the State of Oregon in the Water Rights Division, the Department of Administrative Services to assist in the creation of the Office of Transformation (assuming the role of Black Belt in leading Lean Six Sigma projects).
