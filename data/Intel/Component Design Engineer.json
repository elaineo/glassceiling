Experience Component Design Engineer Intel Corporation January 2012  \u2013 Present (3 years 8 months) Santa Clara, CA Worked in memory controller team. Designed patrol scrub engine, flush engine, and demand scrub. Implemented thermal management logic for memory controller. Implemented error correction code for both near and far memory. Also supported implementation of various design for testing features Validation Design Engineer Intel Corporation August 2010  \u2013  January 2012  (1 year 6 months) Santa Clara, CA Worked on validating thermal management unit. Enhanced reference model that mimics the different stimulus that triggered thermal management. Exercised test under usual and corner cases. \n \nEnhanced I2C reference model. Wrote tests for cluster testing use. Also helped fullchip, high volume testing team, and post silicon team on developing their I2C and thermal management test. \n \nMain contributor to fan speed controller reference model.  \n \nDeveloped design for testing test for cross functional unit teams. \n \nEnhanced and reviewed test plans for thermal management features.
