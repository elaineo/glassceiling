This process minimizes risk to product launch and manages customer differentiation more efficiently.  \n\u2022\tInitiated process improvements to track and manage customer differentiation requests on Intel Xeon platforms. Drove thought leadership on adoption of the new process across the organization. This minimized risk to product launch by improving transparency and communication.  \n\u2022\tManaged validation customer program, tracked status of key data center customers, and provided management updates on program risks and resource requests.  \n\u2022\tDrove resolution for several critical, showstopper issues by pulling in the right experts into task forces.

Lead Design Automation Engineer Intel April 2010  \u2013  August 2012  (2 years 5 months) Santa Clara, California \u2022\tI initiated and drove process improvements for tool releases by developing a software solution to manage tool regressions. This new solution reduced tool bugs by 25%, and improved tool regression time by 50%.  \n\u2022\tI researched, analyzed tools across several projects and identified areas for convergence, then led a team of engineers to develop a common Electrical Rule Check tool across client and server design organizations.  \n\u2022\tI trained a team of 50 engineers and managers on design methodologies, and highlighted best known practices. This resulted in an 85% reduction in user error related support requests. With a more informed well trained design team the project was able to achieve 1.5x faster design convergence.  \n\u2022\tI mentored and trained a summer intern to implement a tool for regression testing. Set goals and expectations. I monitored day-to-day activity, tracked progress and provided guidance. Senior Design Automation Engineer Intel Corporation April 2008  \u2013  May 2010  (2 years 2 months) Santa Clara, California I managed 2 different Performance Verification tools on the Intel Xeon \u00ae family of processors and the Mill Brook Memory Expansion Buffer.  \n \nI improved tool runtime over successive generations of Intel products, greatly reducing the time engineers had for the tool to complete. The tool was run several times as engineers iterated over their designs, so the runtime improvements I made greatly improved productivity.  \n \nI used empirical analysis to improve our simulation models. This resulted in tool simulation results that were closer to actual measurements from the manufactured CPU. This greatly reduced failure due to miscorrelation; avoiding the need for expensive CPU re-spin to fix these failures.  \n \nI provided technical training and support on a regular basis to a design team of approximately 250 engineers. Design Automation Engineer Intel Corporation May 2005  \u2013  March 2008  (2 years 11 months) Santa Clara, California I developed design flow, and methodology for frequency performance verification on the Intel Xeon, and the Intel Core 2 Duo family of processors.  \n \nI worked on qualifying new tool releases, and launching these releases to the design team.  \n \nI provided technical tool support to the rest of the design team. Graduate Research Assistant Optoelectronics research lab June 2002  \u2013  April 2005  (2 years 11 months) I worked for Dr. Kevin Lear in the Opto-electronics Laboratory at Colorado State University. My research was focused on designing, fabricating and testing a CMOS compatible photodiode. The end goal of this research was to develop a method to route clocks inside a silicon integrated circuit using optical interconnects, greatly reducing the transit time of these signals as compared to the traditional metal wire interconnects. As part of this research, I  \n\u2022\tDeveloped and implemented process for Chemical Mechanical edge polishing (CMP) of CMOS ICs in order to couple light into Silicon Nitride waveguides. \n\u2022\tDeveloped process flow for fabrication of a waveguide coupled poly-silicon photo-detector in a 0.35 um CMOS technology.  \n\u2022\tDesigned and implemented the experimental setup for the DC and AC characterization of waveguide coupled poly-silicon and amorphous silicon photodiodes. \n\u2022\tManaged inventory and semiconductor test and characterization equipment at the Colorado State University Semiconductor Processing Laboratory.

Software Design Engineer Intern Microsoft Corp May 2001  \u2013  August 2001  (4 months) Accomplishments: \nDeveloped an Automated Test Framework in JScript for testing the Application Restore tool designed for use with .NET applications. Designed and developed test cases to test both core functionality and UI functionality. Wrote core functionality test scripts to validate the tool in simulated real world scenarios. Wrote UI functionality test scripts that programmatically simulated user interaction (clicking buttons, selecting items within a list) with the tool UI. Extended the UI test scripts to verify the correct sequence of dialog boxes. Generalized the core and UI test scripts to be test case independent. Designed the overall framework to be modular and extensible.
