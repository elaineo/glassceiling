Developed processes to convert binary firmware images into text files suitable for loading into Emulator memories using the Veloce API. Wrote requirements documentation for improved Emulation instrumentation and logging facilities to assist analysis of failures during triage and debug. Validation Engineer Intel Corporation October 2009  \u2013  January 2013  (3 years 4 months) Hillsboro, OR Performed Pre- and Post-Silicon validation of an embedded validation network that provides real-time debug and coverage visibility into key internal system state of the Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 4000-series desktop and mobile SOCs. Extended a C# programming API with a derivative class that added custom programming and user interaction controls used by validation customers to configure 4000-series specific features. Built an Iron-Python test bench configuration generator around this C# class and enabled to run on Linux using the Mono 2.6 CLR.
