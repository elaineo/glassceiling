Fast turn-time award Project Manager 2009 We achieved a very difficult deadline by modifying our normal review process in light of the simplicity of the design involved. The first board did not meet spec, but enabled sales of expensive product. The second board worked correctly, and the overall production of both boards took 75% less time than the organization routinely required for just one turn of a board.
