I developed object-oriented perl modules to represent netlists from different formats as well as a perl script to compare the netlists. On the side I wrote some basic perl scripts to cleanup and standardize the QA test suite. Also, I created a Visual Basic script to automate a weekly report with graphs used to track software quality indicators. \n \nThis 6 month internship through the MECOP program was a great experience.

QA Software Engineering Intern Mentor Graphics April 2008  \u2013  September 2008  (6 months) My main project was developing a way to validate netlists. I developed object-oriented perl modules to represent netlists from different formats as well as a perl script to compare the netlists. On the side I wrote some basic perl scripts to cleanup and standardize the QA test suite. Also, I created a Visual Basic script to automate a weekly report with graphs used to track software quality indicators. \n \nThis 6 month internship through the MECOP program was a great experience. I took on a new language and gained a greater understanding of the software used by chip designers.
