This uncommon combination of expertise and quick learning abilities is key to problem solving, making myself flexible and adaptable to any requirements, always looking for exciting projects and experiences. \n \nFor the past 4 years I've been conducting my research in computer architecture and interconnection networks --- both on-chip and off-chip--- at Intel Labs, in Santa Clara. Here I specialized in rapid computer modeling and performance evaluation of a number of interconnects, including networks-on-chip for multi-core architectures, GPUs, and SoCs. Thanks to a deep understanding of the global computer system as well as all its fine-grain internals required to construct every model, I was able to quickly identify potential problems, find areas of improvement, and create the most efficient solutions to achieve optimal design points. To satisfy my attention to the detail and correctness, I developed my own tools to display information in effective ways that facilitates the decision making process and communication with a broad audience. \n \nBefore that I gained experience as a research scientist under the supervision of Prof. Jose Duato at the Technical University of Valencia at the same time I got my PhD in Computer Engineering. There I taught a number of courses for undergrad and grad school while I conducted my own research in high-radix switches and congestion management techniques for high-performance networks. \n \nOne of the most exciting parts of my career is the opportunity to work with the most privileged minds in the world, not only in the Industry --- thanks to my current work--- but also in the Academia, where I have strong connections and participate in many program committees, journal/conference review processes, and event organizations. Summary I am an extremely creative and innovative person with a PhD in Computer Engineering and a broad background that includes knowledge in Physics (B.S. and M.S), Mathematics (M. Phil), and Biology.
