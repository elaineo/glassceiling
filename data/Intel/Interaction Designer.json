While giving customers choice, chances of weird looking refrigerators coming out of the factory were haunting brand's designers. To guarantee the final product would not do the brand any harm, Brastemp decided to have rules regarding color matching, besides possible configurations of internal parts. Considering user experience, having restrictions on the colors one could choose was a huge set back.
