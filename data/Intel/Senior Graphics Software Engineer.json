December 2007  \u2013  January 2014  (6 years 2 months) Bristol, United Kingdom I was an individual contributor in a high calibre team that developed ARM CPU subsystems. I was made redundant in January as part of the plan to close the Bristol site in March 2014. \n \nI was a hands-on manager with overall responsibility for the verification of ARM CPU subsystems. I was directly responsible for four engineers in Bristol and had functional responsibility for ten engineers in India and two in France. \n \nAs a software engineer, I used a combination of C/C++ and various forms of Assembly to solve a range of problems. I analysed and optimised codecs, counterfeit detection code and benchmarks. I developed a series of production engineering tests to improve manufacturing operations. I wrote modelling software to perform design space exploration and I developed a continuous integration system called the Release Management Server (see below). \n \nI championed the use of Formal Methods within ST. This required me to make recommendations to a Senior Vice President and to work with the CAD vendor (Jasper) at CxO level. I ran the initial evaluation and developed a deployment strategy. My recommendations were accepted by the ST management and I was given the job of overseeing the roll-out of the methodology across the R&D division. \n \nI enjoy working in Verilog and have implemented designs at both ST (for SoCs) and at home (for FPGA). My most recent designs (completed Q3 & Q4 of 2013) were implementations of the ARM Server Base System Architecture Watchdog and Wake-up timers. I also produced unit and formal test environments to expedite verification. Both of these designs have been integrated into forthcoming ST SoCs. \n \nI have also been active in the wider industry and have written a number of papers that were published at leading conferences. Some recent examples include: DAC 2013, DVCon 2013, EETimes 2013, ChipEx 2013 and JUG 2012 - where I won the prize for best paper. See the 'Publications' section for details. Senior Software Engineer STMicroelectronics (R&D) Ltd. November 2006  \u2013  December 2007  (1 year 2 months) Bristol, United Kingdom I started my ST career as a Senior Software Engineer writing device drivers and middleware for security hardware in SoCs targeted at multimedia applications. During this period, I gained experience in large-scale software design, cryptographic hashes, MACs, block ciphers, stream ciphers and public key encryption techniques. More specifically, I wrote and maintained a suite of drivers and middleware for Linux and OS21 (an in-house OS) on a variety of ST SoC platforms. \n \nIn this role, I had substantial contact with Pace and EchoStar (OEM customers) and worked extensively with NDS (a Conditional Access vendor) to drive the certification of new ST chips. Software Engineer U4EA Technologies October 2003  \u2013  November 2006  (3 years 2 months) Bristol (United Kingdom), Sophia-Antipolis (France), Fremont (CA) I was an embedded software engineer, developing C and Assembly code for a range of network routers and applications. U4EA was developing a commercial implementation of a Quality of Service infrastructure called GoS (Guarantee of Service). GoS had been developed at The University of Bristol and U4EA was setup to commercialise this work. \n \nI worked extensively on the Accelerator Processor (AP) sub-system of the ADI Fusiv Network Processor. The APs are small high-speed processing elements that perform per-packet manipulations such as NAT and fire-walling in hardware. Because of this, the code running on the APs was highly performance sensitive and could only be programmed in a variant of MIPS assembler. \n \nI also led the development, testing and acceptance procedure of a T1/E1/J1 WAN interface. This project was based on the Dallas-Maxim DS2155 and included the development of a Frame Relay stack in software. I brought both of these products to market through our reseller (Ericsson).

Winner - Best Paper Award Jasper User Group Meeting November 2012 I won the best paper award at The Jasper User Group (JUG) in Cuppertino, CA. This paper described our experiences using Jasper during the early phases of ST's adoption. At ST, I ran a multi-site evaluation between Bristol, Grenoble and Noida. I regularly interacted with an ST Senior Vice President and with Jasper at CxO level. Ultimately, my recommendations were implemented (at ST) resulting in significant cost savings and a $1.5 Million dollar contract being awarded to Jasper. Winner - The Sullivan Prize The University of Reading July 1999 I received the Sullivan Prize (named in honour of Prof. Geoff Sullivan) for the best Computer Science dissertation. My work was in the area of safety-critical systems. In particular, I was working with Dr. Nimal Nissanke (later Prof.) to develop the concept of a \"Generic Safety Supervisor\" i.e. a device that could provide hard real-time guarantees across a range of safety-critical applications.
