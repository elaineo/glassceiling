Performed Technical Editing and SQA Code Verification for Coriolis Group on technical books to be published (C++, Linux, SQL,, Java and other programming languages) have completed 11 books/manuals by July 1, 2002.. I also perform efficiency analysis, project and program management services and corporate evaluations for various start-up and e-commerce related sites. Design and develop start-up and small business websites. Technologies used: PHP. Perl, Java, Jscript, Ruby, SoapUI, LAMP,, Flash, SWISH, CGI, .Net, ASP, MySQL, SQL, Oracle, Commerce Server, MTS, FrontPage, Apache, IIS, NetMechanic, Monit,, Jmeter, Apache Bench, WAPT, Web Servr Stress Tool, LoadUI, qTrace, Bonfire, Watir, SoapUI, Ranorex, Windmill, UserZoom Silverback, Adobe Flash Builder, EggPlant, Silk, Rational, Test Complete, QTP, Selenium, Jira, TFSTM, REST, BrowserStack, Screenfly, Testdriod, Monkey,Appium, Test Studio, MITE, Robtium, mobiReady, HP, Cucumber, Junit, Nunit, Jira, Hudson, Jenkins, Cruise Control, Ant, and dozens of other automated software tools used in testing internet sites and mobile applications. I have over a terabyte of automated tools I've been using for virtually every aspect of testing starting in 1998 and update weekly with the newest ones being introduced. Too many to list. I developed a new web based Software as a Service product called Quiker QA.  \n \nPerformed work on over 46 contracts- the last 13 months specifically on stealth start-up related mobile products and developed dozens of automated frameworks using Selenium and other tools both for linux (apache) and windows (IIS) server based SaaS, Enterprise, Cloud based systems/environments/products. Utilized over 40 new automated tools for testing mobile to SaaS systems for mobile apps for Android, iOS, Windows platforms.Known to get he job down BEYOND expectations before deadlines  Principal Quality Assurance Analyst Edvation September 2013  \u2013  2014  (1 year) Bellevue Functional - Load - Stress - Performance - UI - Database - End to End and Deployments Principal QA Engineer OpenEye 2013  \u2013  September 2013  (less than a year) OpenEye developed the first linux server DVR that utilizes hundreds of different cameras and through a web interface (all browsers and all mobile apps) that allows a user to view up to 16 different camera views (flash) in one window - allowing the user to add up to 64 different cameras. It also provided Card door Access options as well. This is a huge product to test - from the multiple linux server (both hardware configurations and customized linux programs for monitoring) via hundreds of supported cameras - via all supported browsers and mobile apps using flash to stream up to 16 separate windows in one browser frame via flash. Every possible aspect from different operating systems - hardware - environment - cameras - bandwidth - security - browser compatibility and the of course FLASH issues. Languages were Java, C#, .net. Also performed integration for Cloud storage of the streams stored for each server/ One of the most complex testing environments I have ever seen in almost 15 years. Director of QA Language Weaver 2009  \u2013  2010  (1 year) Marina Del Rey & Los Angeles Managed and led the local QA team for the new launch of the commercial Language Translation Internet SaaS and also managed experienced QA team on the Core legacy packaged product .Additionally hired-trained and managed a new team of junior QA Engineers in Romania simultaneously to work on the java based new commerical Saas as well as the 10-12 backk-end tools constantly in development. Agile methodology running 2 week sprints. QA teams overall success percentage on sprints before I arrived was below 50% - during my management the QA teams overall success percentage was 98%. Managed the legacy Perl scripts for regression testing and build process. Also utilized Selenium across the teams to build a new test framework that was universal across the different projects and teams. Team utilized many different back-end testing tools for database testing of the system including mySQL, sclipse, DataMonster, Load Testing tools. Also integrated Hudson a continuous integration build process. Also managed a physical and virtual lab of over 40 servers and virtual machines as well cloud test machines. Sr SQA Manager Etelos 2008  \u2013  2009  (1 year) Renton I managed a small team of QA and SDEtT engineers to test the Etelos platforms. Etelos is a SaaS development and distribution company. The Etelos Platform Suite is a comprehensive solution for enterprises to publish and distribute Web-based applications and services for businesses, organizations and users. Using the EDE (Etelos Development Environment) programmers can design and develop enterprise based applications. In addition to the continual back-end testing of the Etelos system for bug fixes and new features as well as maintained the unit test cases/scripts for the legacy applications. Also tested all new applications pending to be published to the Etelos Marketplace. Additionally tested the X drive package which allowed customers to store their files in the cloud - performed extensive security - virus - continuity - persistent up/download as well as maximum number of users per server simultaneously. Utilized.Php scripting- dozens of different automation tools. I also performed all the bandwidth-server capacity and load balancing as well as the cloud servers. Performed load/stress testing on all the servers to estimate future growth and traffic. Introduced and trained all team on Agile and Test Driven Development during transition which resulted initially in 2 week then 1 week sprints. QA Manager Palador Inc 2007  \u2013  2008  (1 year) Seattle Managed and tested the numerous applications developed in house for outside companies ranging for large websites to small SQL based back-applications with friendly user interface.

My role was to interpret the architects, development and database teams roles in integrating the multiple legacy systems many that were on different operating systems that provided licensing information for the different customers types that phone and professional support had utilized over the years. The vision was to allow customers to use the internet for customer support (MS was the first to do this) so it involved setting up cutting edge technology to work with old technology. I was tasked with understanding the architectural mapping of using the browser UI from a customers desktop to a firewall then to the first http servers with IIS 1.0, SQL Servers which then routed to the various backend different operating system legacy servers etc.. I designed the first environment the system would eventually be used in production. The test environment consisted of approximately 10-16 servers.

This included having to test Microsoft IPX/SPX protocol which was compatible with Novel Netware Network Client. That worked between Netware Servers/clients and Windows NT 3.5 Networks. Microsoft TCP/IP which only ran in protected mode on windows 95. Microsoft NetBEUI was compatible with existing networks that used NetBIOS like Windows for Workgroups.
