This can be accomplished at various levels in the IC product life cycle. At the design stage, special testability features can be incorporated in the circuit to enhance its overall testability thereby making the otherwise hard to test portions of the design testable at the post silicon stage. At the post silicon stage power discrepancies beyond a certain threshold between two otherwise identical ICs can indicate the presence of a malicious insertion in one of them.

With the growing trend of outsourcing, the sanity of the final product has emerged to be a prime concern for the end user. \n \nIn this work, we have selected power as the side-channel signal to characterize the internal behavior of the ICs. We have used two circuit partitioning based approaches for isolating and enhancing the behavioral difference between parts of a genuine IC and one with a sequence detector Trojan in it. Experimental results reveal that these approaches are effective in exposing anomalous behavior between the targeted ICs. This is reflected as difference in power-profiles of the genuine and maligned ICs that is magnified above the process variation ensuring that the discrepancies are observable.
