My knowledge and exceptional people skills is an asset to this organization. I assist Project Managers, database administrators and QA Engineers on the details of a project to insure the success and on time delivery of a project. I develop and test code for telephone menu programs that use a database or XML for data. I rewrote legacy applications from intervoice to dialogic to get rid of old equipment. I create new enhanced voice services applications in VXML, JSP 2.0 and Parity (like C). I unit test the programs and pass them onto QA. I also modify existing applications for change requests and fix trouble tickets. I am continuing my Java2 education due to the increasing need of these skills in my current position. QA Engineer XO Interactive April 2000  \u2013  December 2005  (5 years 9 months) Portland, Oregon Area I handled many projects simultaneously.
