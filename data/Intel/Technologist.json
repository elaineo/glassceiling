Director of Engineering Program Management Handspring 1999  \u2013  2001  (2 years) Joined startup Handspring as employee #30 and managed the development of Handspring\u2019s first color PDA (the Visor Prism); recruited and hired three engineering program managers who led all of Handspring\u2019s other hardware and software product development projects. Worked directly with Sharp to develop a semi-custom LCD, saving $600K in NRE over a fully custom LCD. Worked directly with Option International in Belgium (going on-site one week per month for six months) to help them successfully complete the GSM radio used in Handspring\u2019s first cellphone (the VisorPhone, predecessor of the Treo smartphone). Functioned as Handspring's display & touchscreen engineer during the first year, leveraging technical expertise developed at GRiD and Fujitsu.  \n \nCreated, developed and successfully implemented a cross-functional product-development life-cycle phase review process which formalized the progression of all engineering projects through eight defined life-cycle phases. The process was based on (a) a core three-person team from engineering, marketing and manufacturing assigned to every major product, (b) detailed departmental checklists for each phase transition, and (c) exception-focused executive-management sign-off meetings for each phase transition.
