Architected and implemented the media streaming application and server that would hand-off A/V streams between WWAN & WLAN transports on WinCE using the MxNMgr infrastructure (10yrs before Samsung release on Android). Developed client applications for the GPS locator infrastructure. Created A/V Video Capture application that streamed video over BT for \u201cuntethered camera\u201d functionality. Served as software lead in charge of porting the Board Support Package (BSP) for each platform on WinCE and three development platforms in between.  \n \nPersonal Video Player Software Lead - Developed all client applications under WinCE including the A/V media playback application using the ILVC MPEG4-part10 (H.264) and MP3. Also created the PSA file format to optimize A/V performance on the XScale processor. Achieved 30fps playback on the Cotulla processor compared to 12fps using CE DirectShow and the disk caching algorithm reduced the hard drive duty cycle to less than 15% yielding significant power savings.  \n Intel Labs - Senior Software Engineer Intel Corporation August 1998  \u2013  March 2002  (3 years 8 months) IAL Technology Harvesting Team \u2013 Technical arm of three person team tasked with distributing IAL technologies to external partners. While deals were signed for Business Streaming Stack and innovative satellite production, none came to fruition due to the dissolution of the Intel Media Streaming division. \n \nIntel Business Streaming Stack,Architect and Team Lead - managed 4 person team that developed an extension of RealPresenter functionality also using DirectShow but with an agnostic streaming infrastructure using NetShow and the Intel ILVC encoder. Also designed and implemented the host GUI and SW stack for the Consus \u201cserver in a pocket\u201d project. \nRealPresenter Sr SW Engineer \u2013 Developed several DirectShow filters such as Wave Capture, Wave Render, G2Core Encoder and the slide capture OCX (aka LivePix) for the RealPresenter G2 media engine (2 patents). Then took over as team lead for the Knowledge Capture Effort and main Intel representative with RealNetworks for RealPresenter8 managing that relationship for more than a year.  \n Intel Labs - Senior Software Engineer Intel Corporation August 1998  \u2013  March 2002  (3 years 8 months) IAL Technology Harvesting Team \u2013 Technical arm of three person team tasked with distributing IAL technologies to external partners.

Then implemented the audio infrastructure for the GroupLink Groupware project. This application audio intercom support as well as automatic presence detection using voice and camera motion detection to let geologically dispersed teammates quickly get in touch. While not brought to market as a product, this application, essentially a pre-cursor of Microsoft Lync, was very popular during internal and external user tests and, as Lync has since.  \n \nApplication Sharing Team Architect \u2013 Designed framework to move Application Sharing to Resource Only Dll architecture (which was enventually adopted by the entire ProShare application suite). For Application Sharing program developed widget to more easily share Apps and served as client side debugging expert (3 patents). Served on Tiger Team for critical ProShare debugging tasks (using SoftIce) and management of the Build Process. Innovations include the ProShare Build WebPage enabling some 20 SW teams to directly update their components in the ProShare build, the IntelSafeWEP library which greatly improved ProShare reliability on Windows 3.1 platforms, and complete redesign of the ProShare 3.0 installation program greatly reducing time to add new modules, enable localization, and also trimming disk space requirements by over 75%.  \n \nAddressBook Team Lead \u2013 Managed 4 person team while serving as the SW architect for the ProShare AddressBook infrastructure. Designed & implemented several shared components such as the Visual Business Card, General Type Manager class. and redesign of supporting database schema to increase performance and reduce application footprint.
