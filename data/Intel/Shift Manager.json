I have been working in the Semiconductor Industry for over 20 years. I have held a variety of roles on every shift while developing and ramping a 10k wspw factory. I like to take control, problem-solve and continuously improve the business through lean manufacturing. I enjoy my job, I understand the process and I consider myself a strong people manager and mentor to others.
