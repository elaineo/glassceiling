Experience Staff Engineer VMware 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year) Bellevue, WA Staff Engineer, Storage VMware 2009  \u2013  2014  (5 years) Palo Alto, CA Worked on VMware's Virtual Flash host based flash caching product and shepherded it into the vSphere 5.5 release as vFRC (vSphere Flash Read Cache). This was the only one of three major storage initiatives that was delivered in the targeted release. Subsequently I worked on the next generation architecture for flash caching on the vSphere host before taking a short-term international assignment with VMware India (Pune office) continuing my prior work on storage management. This work had transitioned offshore and I led a small team to enhance the product which successfully delivered the desired new functionality for the forthcoming vSphere 6.0 release. Prior to this as part of a small team designed and implemented a prototype enabling transparent support in vSphere for storing VM images in local and remote blob stores, including both internal and external clouds, and for running VMs directly from the stored images. As indicated previously, prior to working on cloud storage I worked on storage management for stateless vSphere systems (i.e., deployed on hosts with no persistent media). 2 patents pending on storage management, 3 patents pending on virtualization using blob stores with BASE consistency models, and 4 more pending on flash caching in a virtualized environment. VMkernel USB Architect VMware 2005  \u2013  2009  (4 years) Palo Alto, CA My initial primary focus upon joining VMware was enabling USB support in ESXi. I served as lead, directing self and 2 other engineers, and the effort ranged from kernel drivers to character device nodes enabling access to USB devices by user mode applications and VMs (aka, USB passthru). I designed a ground breaking mechanism (2 patents granted, 1 pending) to safely share USB devices among VMs while preventing DoS and other attacks on the system. Secondary technical focus areas included entropy generation and delivery and NIST certification of same, setup and management of processor MSRs, and hand optimization of hot path code. 2 additional patents granted on other aspects of USB and virtualization. In my spare time I acted as engineering liaison with a major OEM partner during development phase of ESXi and successfully drove resolution of numerous technical issues to keep the OEM onboard with the ESXi program. Virtualization Researcher Intel Corporation 1999  \u2013  2005  (6 years) Worked in the Microprocessor Research Lab analyzing the performance characteristics of Virtual Machine Monitors (VMMs) and hardware support for same.
