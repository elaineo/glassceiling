Developed the overall HLS system architecture. Designed and implemented the front end VHDL lexical and parsing modules in C++ for HLS. Researched and developed Low Power VLSI design methodologies and algorithms targeted toward Low Power applications. Software Design Engineer Intern Microsoft Corp May 2001  \u2013  August 2001  (4 months) Accomplishments: \nDeveloped an Automated Test Framework in JScript for testing the Application Restore tool designed for use with .NET applications. Designed and developed test cases to test both core functionality and UI functionality. Wrote core functionality test scripts to validate the tool in simulated real world scenarios. Wrote UI functionality test scripts that programmatically simulated user interaction (clicking buttons, selecting items within a list) with the tool UI. Extended the UI test scripts to verify the correct sequence of dialog boxes. Generalized the core and UI test scripts to be test case independent. Designed the overall framework to be modular and extensible.

Software Design Engineer Intern Microsoft Corp May 2001  \u2013  August 2001  (4 months) Accomplishments: \nDeveloped an Automated Test Framework in JScript for testing the Application Restore tool designed for use with .NET applications. Designed and developed test cases to test both core functionality and UI functionality. Wrote core functionality test scripts to validate the tool in simulated real world scenarios. Wrote UI functionality test scripts that programmatically simulated user interaction (clicking buttons, selecting items within a list) with the tool UI. Extended the UI test scripts to verify the correct sequence of dialog boxes. Generalized the core and UI test scripts to be test case independent. Designed the overall framework to be modular and extensible.
