Started Intel career in Cambridge, UK (June 2004 - December 2006) and was lastly based in Pittsburgh, PA., spending a small amount of time working out of the Berkeley, CA lab. Responsibilities spanned BigData architecture design and processing, development, project management, purchasing, and also highly visible technology transfers within Intel and external entities. While working full time at Intel, managed to finish the requirements of a Ph.D. in computer science showing extreme dedication, determination, and discipline.  \n \nActed as an ambassador to Intel\u2019s efforts in the cloud computing and BigData research \ndomain since 2007 and is an active member of the Open Cirrus cloud computing initiative. This \ninitiative brought together a community of 12 institutions in the design and implementation of \nan open source software stack for large scale data centers. Led the development effort on Intel\u2019s side and also closely collaborated with Open Cirrus members from Yahoo, HP Labs, MIMOS (Malaysia), ETRI (Korea), and Georgia Institute of Technology. Presented multiple talks and tutorials at leading universities, high profile conferences in the area (e.g., Supercomputing 2010), and organizations within Intel corporation. \n \nEarned four divisional recognition awards for excellence in the execution of the following initiatives: BigData and cloud computing research, melanoma detection and interactive search of medical repositories, and next generation network services. \n \nWhile in Pittsburgh, architected, built and managed the 1500+ core Open Cirrus Cloud Computing Research Platform with a particular focus on creating an infrastructure management system to dynamically provision and allocate physical nodes on demand. Currently have built BigData and cloud infrastructures on three continents.
