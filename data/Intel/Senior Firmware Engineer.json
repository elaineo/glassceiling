Embedded Software Engineer at Nokia Siemens Networks AZCOM technology February 2006  \u2013  January 2010  (4 years) Milan Area, Italy I worked as Embedded SW Engineer in the PHY Team of Siemens BTS.  \nIn particular I specialized on GPRS and EGPRS field, analyzing and developing new features for packet data transmission.  \n \nIn my activity I was involved in different task for supporting different teams to solve problem on BTS also in the field and in different country as China, Germany and Prague. \n \nThanks to my experience on siemens BTS architecture I was the reference person for my team in the GEMINI project which scope was the integration of Siemens BTS in Nokia GSM Network.  \nIt was an amazing activity I strongly contribute from the feasibility study to the first pilot testing on China.  \n \nThe experience on NSN allowed me to had daily collaboration with other groups of development, testing and hardware design, located worldwide (mainly Italy, Germany, Finland and India). \n \nExperience: \n- specialist in ex-Siemens BTS layer one software for CU, GCU, ECU and FCU boards; \n- strong experience in C Embedded programming on real time constrain in particular on TI DSP (C6416,C6412); \n- good experience on Assembly programming for Texas Instrument c5409 DSP; \n- good experience on GPRS EGPRS protocol; \n- strong experience in offline test environment; \n- good experience in software development for test environment, using different programming languages as Perl, C, C++.
