Process Development Engineer Intel Corporation June 2013  \u2013  April 2014  (11 months) Hillsboro, OR Process Development Engineer at Intel Corporation in the Logic Technology Design Group.

Research Assistant Purdue University August 2008  \u2013  April 2013  (4 years 9 months) West Lafayette, IN Nyah Zarate, obtained her Ph.D. in the area Particulate Design and behavior characterization at the CHE department in Purdue University. As a research assistant, Nyah was responsible for multiple design, modeling, and simulation projects in the areas of Powder Technology, Particulate design, and manufacturing of Power material. In her Ph.D. dissertation titled \u201cMultiscale Modeling of Particulate Systems by Incorporating Particle Roughness\u201d, Powder behavior during solids handling, such as in the pharmaceutical, food, and personal care industries, is controlled to a large degree by the adhesion characteristics of the powder\u2019s particulate ensemble characteristics. Key physical properties of a particulate system, such as size, geometry, composition, and surface roughness, generally control the particle adhesion. Regardless of the application, there is a general need to control and understand the interactions at the particle-substrate and particle-particle interfaces at micro- to nano-meter scales in order to predict powder behavior and increase efficiency during the industrial processes of solids. Nyah developed and experimentally validated a model to predict adhesion force calculation of particles-surfaces interactions. The model is able to represent particle-surface interactions accurately and with greater robustness by accounting for surface roughness developed Matlab based Discrete Element Method routines. \n PhD NSF fellow Engineering Research Center of Structured Organic Particulate Systems (ERC-SOPS) Purdue University December 2009  \u2013  December 2012  (3 years 1 month) Purdue University C-SOPS focuses on understanding basic aspects of pharmaceutical and manufacturing science where lack of knowledge has been a fundamental barrier to the development of and manufacture of newer dosage forms.
