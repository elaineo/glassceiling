Earphone cords and mobile phone charging cables are must haves, for example. It is annoying when our cables become intertwined and tangled in our bag. Pop-up Cord Wrap aims to resolve the problem of the storage and management of cables, so they stay organised and tangle-free for easy access when needed. \nThis relatively flat and compact cord wrap contains three compartments for different sizes of cable. The top layer has a small opening in which to wedge the connector. Made of rubber, Pop-up Cord Wrap pops up to allow for the coiling of the cables and pushes back to store them neatly. Whichever layer you need, just push it out to use. Pop-up Cord Wrap is soft yet tough, serving as a protective case.

By integrating Intel RealSense Technology and the Perceptual Computing SDK, we enabled 360\u00b0 panoramic video with touch and gesture interactions. We also innovated ways to curate and annotate this content into a working prototype. We demonstrated our work at the headquarters of a prominent news and media company, securing a commit win for this solution. I used tools such as Balsamiq to create wireframes and sketches that illustrated compelling usages of our technology. I also provided an implementation guide for partner\u2019s existing websites. \n \nDuring this internship, I was also able to work with a UX Firm (Empir- acle) to perform a Heuristic Evaluation of Mozzilla Firefox. We were tasked with making suggested improvements for ways to optimize the Firefox experience on Intel 2 in 1 devices.

I worked with a team of other engineers to building a working prototype using 9 Go-Pro cameras and a hardware rig. It was my responsibility to also create a presentation that would showcase the array technology, and possible use cases. As the UX designer I brainstormed use cases, scouted locations to capture camera array images for the presentation and created a concept video that would highlight an innovative experience.

Also responsible for 10 other mentors. UX Intern in the Automotive Solutions Division Intel Corporation May 2012  \u2013  August 2012  (4 months) As an UX intern, I created personas and day-in-the-life narratives which were instrumental in assessing the needs and wants of consumers and providing a foundation to streamline the efforts of various groups within the division. Assessed user experience through first and second hand value-added research, thereby strengthening the validity of market segmentation findings. Finally, developed innovative solutions and defined interactions through the design of use cases for potentially lucrative market segments, which served to supplement the implementation of new technology. Marketing & Communications Intern Maxim Communications Group May 2007  \u2013  January 2009  (1 year 9 months) While at Maxim, I assisted in facilitating and planning community events and brainstorming other marketing efforts around the state of South Carolina for Maxim clients.

By integrating Intel RealSense Technology and the Perceptual Computing SDK, we enabled 360\u00b0 panoramic video with touch and gesture interactions. We also innovated ways to curate and annotate this content into a working prototype. We demonstrated our work at the headquarters of a prominent news and media company, securing a commit win for this solution. I used tools such as Balsamiq to create wireframes and sketches that illustrated compelling usages of our technology. I also provided an implementation guide for partner\u2019s existing websites. \n \nDuring this internship, I was also able to work with a UX Firm (Empir- acle) to perform a Heuristic Evaluation of Mozzilla Firefox. We were tasked with making suggested improvements for ways to optimize the Firefox experience on Intel 2 in 1 devices.

There is something really cathartic about taking a mess of post its and turning it into a wall of organized insights. And while I love designing based on these insights, sometimes good ideas can happen without all that research and synthesis.

In order to bring programming such as occurs during GameStorm, Stumpquest, and The Victory Condition to life, we rely upon those who share our love of games to volunteer their time. \n \nIn service to this group I oversee the: \n- expansion of scope (through additional events and organizational partnerships) \n- refinement of artifacts (by recruiting talent and guiding production) \n- evolution of ad strategy (by expanding the range of targeted demographics and associated messaging) Game Designer & Consultant Robert LaCosse LLC July 2011  \u2013 Present (4 years 2 months) Vancouver, OR Having thoroughly invested myself in the quest to gain a comprehensive understanding of game design (psychology, fabrication, mechanics, et al.) since I was 12, I believe I have attained a level of mastery that allows me to self-identify as a Game Designer. To augment my knowledge base in an academic context, I wrote an independent study while at the Art Institute of Portland, which saw the creation of the Deluvia card game.  \n \nCurrent projects include: \nDeluvia - An Alt-Victorian card game in which players represent heads of waring factions, send airships to capture opponents' locations, and cobble technologies together to build a time machine to alter the course of the past and move the state of the present in their favor. \n \nIn The Afterward - A card game in which players assemble clues from past lives and leverage cognitive tools to reveal the great meaning behind their present existence.  \n \nFluff the Mark - Players in this card game take command of their own design agency. As such, they must draw cards from the resource pool to discover contract opportunities, locate talent, and identify ways of undermining their competitors. \n \nMeme: The Game - Meme challenges players to create original internet phenomena, caption them, and vote for who has the most viral potential. Players draw from a central deck, which consists of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and wild cards, and assemble a string which all players caption and then vote upon. \n \nAmulet Arcanus - A LARP in which players take on the role of a wizard or cleric, with unique spells and abilities commensurate with their class, and face off against a number of foes in an epic quest for an all-powerful amulet. \n \nDanger&Play - A Lovecraftian murder mystery for up to 20 players that incorporates up to 11 plot points each containing between 2 and 8 characters. Deception, collusion, and ultimately murder are all in the cards for players seeking the most dangerous plaything.

Having demonstrated my work ethic and sincere commitment to student success, I was then asked by Jamie Hurd, the Director of the Industrial Design Department at that time, to take on the responsibilities associated with maintaining the department website. In addition, I made myself available when the need arose for a representative to field questions from incoming or prospective students during a variety of school sponsored events.

That is the essential question. In answering it we discover not only where we have come from, but where we are going. Environmental circumstances have remained constant for several thousand years (arguably since the dawn of mankind) and certain games have arisen to either mimic or supplement our daily routines (whether warfare or other, more collaborative thinking, activity). However, now, we find ourselves in unfamiliar territory. It is for this reason that we are, truly, at the dawn of the Ludic Century. \n \nAt our hip is what scholars of old may refer to as the \"magician\u2019s assistant\". It holds access to all the knowledge of mankind and more. It gives us a gateway into the lives of untold others. \n \nIn an effort to utilize this great power and bridge the gap across hundreds of miles of separation, we now have a responsibility to build games like never before. They are games which impart experiences, rather than seek a single victor. They demand their players access and evolve whole new parts of their emotive and empathic complex. They are the games that signal the Age of Play ushered in on the shoulders of the Internet of Things. \n \nLet\u2019s talk about this. Lecturer CHIFOO November 2013 As part of the \"Quantifying Kick-Ass\" 2013 lecture series, I delivered \"Authentically Kick Ass\" which detailed the nature of authenticity and how games enable a new level of UX strategy in their ability to repeatedly produce authentic experiences.
