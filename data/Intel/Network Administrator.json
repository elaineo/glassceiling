Experience Owner JST & Associates 2000  \u2013 Present (15 years) Portland, Oregon Area JST and Associates began as a Network Business in the early 2000's. We trained hundreds of new business owners how to develop a business plan, set goals, develop sales skills and achieve better lives through increased personal income.  \nAs the internet changed we did as well. Leaving the business development aspect behind we began to invest in real-estate in early 2005. JST & Associates became Trefethen Real- Estate Investing and plunged into the home flipping market. Successfully flipping three homes in two years we exited the flipping market in 2008 just as the real-estate market went into free fall. Electing to take two years off and go sailing with our kids we purchased a boat in the British Virgin Islands and explored the Caribbean.  \nJST then moved into the Foreclosure market and has been purchasing and rehabbing rental properties on the East Coast since 2009.  \nAs a spinoff to the business I am now developing a home remodeling branch specializing in higher end Bathrooms in the Portland, Oregon area. Senior Managing Director Omarsea November 2012  \u2013  December 2013  (1 year 2 months) South Pacific Blue Water Sailing Adventure; Annapolis Maryland to Whangarie, NewZealand \n \nOver the course of six months we outfitted a 51 foot sailing vessel for a voyage of 10, 000 nautical miles. The vessel was rebuilt from the keel up; re powered, rigging, plumbing, electrical, refrigeration, solar array, navigation & communications systems installed.  \n \nHome School for my three teenagers was modified to fit the rigors of life at sea such that I could facilitate the children's continued education process.  \n \nLeaving Annapolis in early November soon after super storm Sandy we sailed down the Eastern Seaboard to SW Florida and completed outfitting the boat there. Then we sailed to Panama and made the passage through the canal during it's 100 year celebration. From there we sailed to the Galapagos Isles and witnessed the giant tortoise, the sea life and the marine iguanas. After the Galapagos we completed the 3300 mile passage to the Marquesas and spent three months exploring French Polynesia. We watched fire dances and tribal ceremonies. We swam with sharks and rays in Bora bora. From Moorea we sailed to the kingdom of Tonga and visited Neafu. We made friends there and swam with the humpback whales. We also visited hidden underwater caves and saw the flying fox bats. After bidding Tonga farewell we sailed for Fiji and Viti Lavu. There we visited Suva and Malolo Lala enjoying the Musket cove Regatta week activities. As our time in Fiji came to a close we made our preparations for the passage south and the 1000 miles to New Zealand. Conditions were rough on our arrival in Opua but we managed to complete the checkin and sailed South through the bay of islands to Whangarie where we based our exploration of the Northern Island over the next three months. \n \nLessons learned; \n \nIf it can be done do it. \nNever say \"I can't \" \nDo today what needs to be done now. \nDream big, plan well, go and do it.
