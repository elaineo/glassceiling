Jazz 2.1 \nProcessor Architecture. This work included the insertion of debug circuitry into \nthe Jazz 2.1 Processor Architecture. Required creation of automated scripts to \ngenerate and insert scan chains into the specified processor so that these scan \nchains could be used by the debug circuitry to read current state of the processor. Senior ASIC Design Engineer Intrinsix Corp February 1999  \u2013  March 2000  (1 year 2 months) Design-Compiler based automatic synthesis methodology for \nthe Digital Signal Processor division of Texas Instruments. This consisted of sets \nof scripts (DC-shell and C-shell) which can be used by a designer to compile a \nhierarchical design and achieve quick turn around of design modifications. This \nscript gives the designer flexibility to modify constraints for any sub-block of \nthe design as he sees fit in a simple and uniform manner. This synthesis suite was \nused to synthesize the Multi-Channel Buffered Serial Port (MCBSP) Texas Instruments \nGS30ka 0.15 micron technology running at 100MHz. \n\u00b7 Developed Synopsys, Inc. Design-Compiler based synthesis methodology for a wireless \ncommunications division of Nortel Networks. The flow had to handle both manually \ngenerated RTL code which follows a set of design guidelines and also code which was \nautomatically generated via Cadence Design Systems, Inc. Signal Processing \nWorkbench (SPW) toolset. This consisted of sets of scripts (DC-shell and C-shell) \nwhich can be used by a designer to compile a hierarchical design using the standard \ntwo-pass, compile-characterize-writescript-recompile methodology for greatest \nflexibility in quick turn around of design modifications. This synthesis suite was \nused to synthesize a set of three (3) ASICs, the largest of which was an ~1.1 \nmillion gate design using Texas Instruments GS30 0.15 micron technology running at \n100MHz. \n\u00b7 Responsible for integration and debug of Intrinsix uplatform\u00ae transactor based \ndesign environment with Cadence Design Systems, Inc.

Principal ASIC Design Engineer Cadence Design Systems, Inc January 1997  \u2013  February 1999  (2 years 2 months) \u00b7 Developed address table memory interleaved memory access controller block for an \nATM chipset to meet customer specifications. Multiple interleaved state machines \nallow for normal memory accesses for passing and possible modification of ATM data \ncells as well as interleaving system memory access requests with the data stream. \nDesigned to trigger multiple fault detects based upon invalid parity or invalid \ndata reads from non-filled address locations. Designed using behavioral VHDL code \nas customer input to flow. Responsibilities included micro-architectural \nspecifications, RTL design, synthesis, simulation and static timing analysis. \nDesign used full scan test methodology (Approx. 200k gates). \n\u00b7 Developed synthesis scripts for automated synthesis of VHDL or Verilog RTL design \ninto gates which was used by entire department.

During my \nrole as synthesis lead, I worked with the other designers to help modify their code \nin order to allow for better synthesis with respect to design speed and area \nconstraints. This required a knowledge not only of the synthesis tools but also an \nability to quickly see what the original designers intentions were and be able to \nparse out a better version of code for the synthesis tool to work with. Senior ASIC Design Engineer Eastman Kodak Company June 1988  \u2013  January 1997  (8 years 8 months) \u00b7 Developed department design flow for use with the Motorola design library suite. \nThis design flow included the generation of a set of UNIX and Synopsys scripts \nwhich can be used to reinsert hierarchy back into the design after Motorola returns \na flat Verilog netlist of the design, post-layout. \n\u00b7 Developed department design flow for design verification using the LSI libraries \nand VHDL VITAL simulations with complete SDF back-annotation capability. \n\u00b7 Two patents granted for CD WORM drive wobble data read circuitry.
