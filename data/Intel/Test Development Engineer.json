I am seeking an internship in electrical engineering or computer science. \n \nMy UCLA curriculum has given me a great opportunity to develop a wide set of skills in both the electrical engineering and computer science fields. I have taken classes ranging from electromagnetism to signal processing and from a year of C/C++ to VHDL to operating systems and network design. \n \nTwo classes that really let me prove my growth as a student were Digital Signal Processing Lab and Hardware Design Lab. In digital signal processing lab I worked in a team to do signal processing and designed a final project. In the final project we programmed a DSP chip to do image processing and then optimized our algorithm to work faster on the multiple thread ability of the DSP. \n \nIn the hardware design lab I worked in a team to program an FPGA. For our final project we created a gesture based first person shooter video game. We used a video camera as our input and tracked the users movement. Targets were shown on the monitor and the user would aim at the target and make a \"shoot\" gesture. If a hit was detected, a point was given. All this was done by programming the FPGA. \n \nI have also had the opportunity to gain experience outside of the classroom. In my student research position I built a circuit boards to take readings inside an MRI machine. I also created and maintained a few websites for the medical department. At my position I also developed code for medical software and computer lab maintenance. I designed software for network and user management to make ensure users did not take up too much of the network storage. \n \nAll of this work has fueled my desire to learn more. Now I have 5+ years experience in C/C++, Python, Bash, OOAD, PHP, HTML, CSS and Linux. Some of these I taught myself because I wanted to learn more. Now I continue to design programs for myself and teach myself new skills to better myself. Specialties:Object oriented programming, web design, Python, C/C++, Bash, PHP, HTML, CSS, VHDL, Linux, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Dreamweaver, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint. Summary I am a student at UCLA majoring in Electrical Engineering with a Computer Science Option. I am seeking an internship in electrical engineering or computer science. \n \nMy UCLA curriculum has given me a great opportunity to develop a wide set of skills in both the electrical engineering and computer science fields. I have taken classes ranging from electromagnetism to signal processing and from a year of C/C++ to VHDL to operating systems and network design. \n \nTwo classes that really let me prove my growth as a student were Digital Signal Processing Lab and Hardware Design Lab. In digital signal processing lab I worked in a team to do signal processing and designed a final project. In the final project we programmed a DSP chip to do image processing and then optimized our algorithm to work faster on the multiple thread ability of the DSP. \n \nIn the hardware design lab I worked in a team to program an FPGA. For our final project we created a gesture based first person shooter video game. We used a video camera as our input and tracked the users movement. Targets were shown on the monitor and the user would aim at the target and make a \"shoot\" gesture. If a hit was detected, a point was given. All this was done by programming the FPGA. \n \nI have also had the opportunity to gain experience outside of the classroom.
