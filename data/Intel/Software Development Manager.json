Experience Engineering Manager, PC Client Services, Intel Architecture Group (IAG) Intel Corporation November 2008  \u2013 Present (6 years 10 months) Engineering manager for Intel\u2019s Remote PC Assist (RPAT) program. Responsible for the engineering output of ~ 45 people located in Jerusalem, Folsom, Hillsboro, Cordoba, and through our partnership company in Boston and Budapest. We architected, built, validated, and deployed an Internet based \u2018software as a service\u2019 solution using Intel AMT (vPro) technology to connect to the software cloud based infrastructure and service we built to enable managed service providers and Telcos to provide out-of-band network and OS support to end customers even when their customer\u2019s network, or OS, may be down. We successfully landed major firmware design wins with HP, Lenovo and several smaller OEM\u2019s. We launched partnerships with two ISV\u2019s building remote PC support applications using our RPAT SDK, and we also achieved a major customer design win with AT&T. My role involves leadership of all engineering aspects of software, firmware, validation, data center infrastructure, security, performance investigation, driving process change, problem solving, setting strategic prioritization, and collaborating with multiple business groups to set plans and meet our goals, including CCG and MWG. Systems, Tools, and Controls Team Manager Intel Corporation. Global Workforce Mobility October 2006  \u2013  October 2008  (2 years 1 month) Manager of a team of 12, across 4 campuses, responsible for the entire global systems infrastructure, financial controls, process controls, and audit of: relocation, expense reimbursement, corporate travel, and corporate calling cards. Collectively $650M of spends were processed through these systems annually.  \n \nIn 2007 my team landed a completely redesigned relocation systems infrastructure doubling the transactional efficiency of our operations group. Within the organization we simultaneously completed a series of outsource RFP\u2019s, ultimately validating our dramatically superior internal cost efficiency versus any external vendor. Of particular note we demonstrated a 5x cost benefit versus the leading technical outsource solution. My most unique achievement of 2007 was the licensing of our technology and software to a 3rd party relocation services company, a first ever external licensing from within HR at Intel, in a deal valued at approximately $4M. Global Processes & Systems Manager Intel Corporation, Worldwide Relocation July 2002  \u2013  September 2006  (4 years 3 months) During 2002 and 2003 I managed a team of 25 business analysts and project managers across six global locations, driving the initial deployment of Intel\u2019s first global Relocation automation data system, handling legal, tax, and reporting compliance automation and driving global standardization of both processes and systems. \n \nFrom 2004 through 2006 I directed all global systems improvements in Relocation, architecting the design of a multi-year roadmap. This involved providing vision, leadership, and influence to drive Relocation\u2019s systems strategy to further automate improvements in: quality, through put time, and eliminating manual work of our operational staff, during this time the organization handled greater complexity while achieving a 30% reduction in HC largely due to our systems improvements. During this period I successfully managed a team of up to 15 direct reports, often receiving 100% scores in Intel\u2019s management surveys. Internet Software Development Manager Intel Corporation, New Business Group March 2000  \u2013  July 2002  (2 years 5 months) I was responsible for managing the engineering and development of major components of a multi-patent pending large scale Internet and Business systems management solution for Internet Service Providers and Managed Service Providers. In the latter part of the development phase my team was brought into Intel Online Service (IOS) to leverage our software, making IOS our primary customer. Numerous technologies and languages were used, including: Java, (Core, Servlets, Applets, and Swing), SQL2000, XML, CIM, DHCP, PXE, BOOTP, IIS, Apache, SSL, and Windows 2000.  \n \nMy team and I were responsible for architecting and designing the application side of the system, involving aspects of human factors engineering for the GUI design, performance optimization, security, encryption, rules-engine enabled automation, and automated hands-off remote operating system provisioning. During the course of the project I was also directly responsible for the detailed design, development, and optimization of the code for the security system, remote provisioning system, SQL schema, and stored procedures. \n \nIn late 2001 I merged into Intel Online Services (IOS) and became the manager of two additional teams beyond my original team from the Advanced Technology Organization, for a total of 12 direct reports. These teams were responsible for the IOS Server Build System and the Customer Care Portal. Both products were in daily use by IOS staff, and IOS customers respectively. I rapidly merged the three teams and the functionality of the projects creating a more effective single team and integrated solution.  \n \nUnder my management the Customer Care Portal transitioned into a key \u201cUp-Sell\u201d tool used by Marketing and the Customer Account Managers. At the same time the Customer Care Portal flourished from being ranked almost last by industry analysts to, by the middle of 2002, being ranked in the top quartile of 38 competitors. Manager & Architect Intel Corporation, IT October 1999  \u2013  March 2000  (6 months) I was promoted to managing my 12 software development peers in the team in which I had worked during the previous three years. Projects included: eCommerce development supporting www.intel.com, development and support of the corporate-wide account management system (Rialto), secure document transfer (ERCD), and the encrypted file transfer with our financial partners for the Stock Options Program. Software Design Engineer Intel Corporation, IT January 1997  \u2013  October 1999  (2 years 10 months) I was the designer and lead developer of the Electronic Registered Confidential Documents (ERCD) project. This project involved integrating our software with numerous third party vendors and an even larger number of groups at Intel. The software used digital certificates, strong encryption, custom tailored \"click to accept\" agreements and also supported instant revocation of user rights when necessary. The implementation included ASP and C++ COM for the front end, C++ for the middle tier, and a Microsoft SQL backend. \n \nI designed and implemented components of the authentication and authorization software to provide secure eCommerce support for Intel's customer business. The project achieved $1B of E-commerce exchange in the first two weeks after release. As a direct result of the software developed by our team, Intel, at one point, held the record for the largest eCommerce dollar-transaction-volume of any company worldwide.
