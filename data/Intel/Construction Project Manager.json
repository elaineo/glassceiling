I worked on bikes for the neighborhood kids to fix problems ranging from flat tires to gears. While working on my bachelor's degree at St Martin's, I noticed that they didn't have someone to maintain the computers in the computer lab. So I offered to be their computer lab support and in exchange they covered the cost of one of my classes each semester. They agreed and helped pay for my bachelor's degree. \n \nGoing through college, I am among a select few who can claim that I did it without grants, loans, or  \nhelp from my parents. I was with the US Army for 12 years and used my GI Bill to pay for my Bachelor's degree. While I worked for Intel, they covered the cost of my MBA. I worked and used the resources available to cover my college expenses. Hence, I graduated with both my Bachelors and my Masters degree completely debt free. \n \nWith Intel, this has transferred over and I've worked to solve the problems that both Intel has and their customers. I've worked as technical support for large customers and internally, helped to save Intel $10M by implementing a program in the factory to reuse items in the construction process. As a PMP-certified project manager with over 10 years of experience, I've worked on budgets to stay within the defined amounts while meeting the project schedule. \n \nI love being creative and coming up with alternative solutions to complex problems. So send me a message and we can talk about how I can help you. \n \nSpecialties: Problem solving, business development, software development lifecycle (waterfall), software project management, firmware, and project management.
