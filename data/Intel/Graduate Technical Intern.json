Graduate Technical Intern Intel Corporation May 2010  \u2013  December 2010  (8 months) I worked as Graduate Technical Intern in Intel Corporation in the Software and Services Group (SSG). I worked with Application Engineers at Intel Wallstreet Lab, Parsippany and helped in optimizing financial applications(wallstreet applications) to take advantage of the latest Intel software and hardware innovations. I also did competitive analysis by comparing performance of Intel products with offerings from other competitors. I also worked on optimizing non-financial applications for Intel latest products like Nehalem-EX servers, Westmere-EX servers, MIC and others. Graduate Research Assistant Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University December 2009  \u2013  May 2010  (6 months) I continued my earlier efforts on parallelizing compute intensive applications and improving the performance on GPUs. I finished my thesis, Accelerating Hardware Simulation on Multicores. I successfully defended my thesis and headed for another internship with Intel Corporation at their Wallstreet Lab in Parsippany, NJ. Graduate Technical Intern Intel Corporation May 2009  \u2013  December 2009  (8 months) I worked for Architecture, Validation and System-level Solutions (ASVS) team under Design and Technology Solutions (DTS) group in Intel Corporation. I concentrated my effort on improving the simulation performance using Intel multi-cores in order to speed up the overall validation process. I also worked on utilizing Larrabee as accelerator for improving simulation performance. Graduate Research Assistant Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University October 2008  \u2013  May 2009  (8 months) I joined Dr. Sandeep K. Shukla's FERMAT Lab and started researching on utilizing multicore CPU and GPGPUs to speed up compute intensive tasks. In my initial research, I concentrated on accelerating system-level validation by speeding up SystemC simulations. System level validation was a compute intensive task that could take days to complete and consume majority of the testing and verification time. SystemC, a widely used hardware modeling language was our target language. We developed SCGPSim, a simulation tool which can simulate SystemC RTL designs on NVIDIA GPUs. In this effort we showed how the power of GPUs can be used to speed up compute intensive tasks like system-level simulations.
