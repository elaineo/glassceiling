VP, Mobile Product Development McAfee Security January 2012  \u2013  March 2014  (2 years 3 months) Santa Clara, CA Responsible for leading the product development of McAfee's mobile portfolio, including McAfee's Mobile Security (consumer), McAfee's Enterprise Mobility Management (enterprise), and McAfee Mobile Labs (mobile-focused threat research). Lead a global 200+ people team, targeting all major mobile operating systems and form factors. President and GM, Intel Software, Argentina; Director of McAfee's integration Intel Corporation March 2006  \u2013  January 2012  (5 years 11 months) Started this R&D center, and the Argentina software subsidiary of Intel. Responsible for all aspects of the creation, ramp, and operations of the subsidiary, which ramped from scratch to 200+ employees. Responsibilities included organization of the design center, marketing, product development, HR, finances, operations, and public relations. The center won all kinds of awards, set a new benchmark for how to start new remote sites, and was pivotal in the two most strategic projects within the Software and Services Group during the time of my tenure: (1) the inception, development, and launch of AppUp, Intel's foray into the appstore business, and (2) expansion through inorganic growth, leading to the acquisition of McAfee. \n \nMcAfee is the largest acquisition in Intel's history, by far. It is also a bold move into commercial software for a semiconductor company. Having been involved with initiating and supporting this strategic move, I was responsible for driving the overall business interaction between Intel and McAfee by helping maintain the stand-alone integrity of the subsidiary; and leading the team to identify and deliver Intel-McAfee synergy opportunities in products, sales, infrastructure, etc. Executive Director, Concept Design & Business Development Verizon September 2000  \u2013  March 2006  (5 years 7 months) Recruited back to Verizon to build a business transformation group tasked with conceptualizing and launching new services, and optimizing the Web infrastructure. Managed a 250+people, $25M budget. \n \nWe created a number of products and services within Verizon, as well as the underlying infrastructure required to actually deploy and operate these services. In addition, I was the lead for information technology when Verizon went into the television business, creating FiOS TV. I led the strategic work, business development, and negotiation with key vendors (Microsoft, Motorola), as well as the engineering execution of key programs until \"lights on\". Principal Verizon April 1997  \u2013  October 2000  (3 years 7 months) Senior member of a team of 20+ computer scientists, engineers, and software developers. Notably, I designed and built a rule-based form validation engine which automated processing of service request forms, thus fulfilling an FCC mandate, saving GTE hundreds of millions of dollars. The system was operational long after I left that job, and continued to hum and withstand a number of \"requirement revisions\" without any needs for refactoring or any major overhauling. Senior Technical Specialist Fidelity Investments November 1996  \u2013  April 1997  (6 months) Recruited to introduce advanced reengineering and application development methodologies.
