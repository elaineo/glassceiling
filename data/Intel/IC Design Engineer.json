Experience Analog IC Design Engineer Intel Corporation May 2011  \u2013 Present (4 years 4 months) I work in a group that does \"special circuits\", which means that we do outside-the-box designs. Basically, I do analog design. Electrical Engineering Intern Intel Corporation September 2010  \u2013  May 2011  (9 months) For this internship, I am working in Intel's ECG group as a systems engineer. We do platform validation, which is basically a motherboard that has FPGAs to control everything to test all of Intel's brand-new chips. Naturally, there are a LOT of interfaces on this board (SPI, SMBus, PCIe, SATA...to name a few) so it provided a great learning experience for me, as well as a fun one because I enjoy learning more and more about how PCs work. \n \nMy main intern project is to write software to communicate with supplied drivers from FTDI to utilize three interfaces: I2C(SMBus), SPI, and JTAG. So, I had to write a program that would use each interface as needed. A fairly lengthy project. \n \nI also worked directly on debug of our platform. It was built to test a specific PCH that Intel was developing at the time. I also participated in a power-on, which was a fantastic, if not unbelievably tiring, experience. \n \nFinally, I led a team of PSU students designing a memory voltage regulator for standard DDR memory. This module was able to plug into the board to supply the ~75 Watts (max) necessary to power the memory. Teaching Assistant Purdue University August 2008  \u2013  May 2010  (1 year 10 months) Currently I am teaching two lab sections, two \"DPS\" (Directed Problem Solving) sections, and holding three hours of office hours per week for the course ECE270. This is a basic course on digital system design. \n \nDuring the summer, I was promoted to \"Course Instructor\" for ECE202, \"Linear Circuit Analysis II\". This is Purdue's second circuit theory class which covers s-domain analysis, convolution, transformers, and two-port circuits. As Course Instructor, I was in charge of preparing and presenting lectures, writing and grading exams, and assisting students whenever necessary. \n \nIn the Spring of 2010, I was honored as a recipient of both the Magoon award for TA excellence and the CETA teaching award. Both are only given to a select few students, and to have both honors speaks to my communication ability and understanding of the coursework. Electrical Engineering Intern Garmin International May 2008  \u2013  August 2008  (4 months) This was my second internship at Garmin International. My project was to redesign the output circuitry for the fishfinders 300c and 400c, as well as variations of those models. Originally, the work was only to encompass finding a new turns ratio for the output step-up transformer, but I completed that quickly and moved on to designing a new output power supply, which was a switching supply able to handle more current, and was significantly cheaper than the previous version. This addition was significant because one of the main marketing specifications is the output power, which I was able to increase while saving money at the same time. In my spare time, I was also able to help the other more senior engineers with their projects where I learned more about the project cycle in a large company and compliance testing procedures. Part-Time Electrical Engineering Intern Advanced Manufacturing Institute September 2007  \u2013  May 2008  (9 months) At AMI, I was originally hired to work on a rebar sensor being developed for KDOT. I finished and organized the previous work that had been done, and had a design ready to pass to the PCB designers. Since I again completed my first project ahead of schedule, I also worked on several other projects. First, I diagnosed two different problems in two different broken milling machines. One I was able to fix on-site and the other was fixed after ordering a new part. Yet another project I worked on was a project for KDOT that uses an RF link to estimate a car's wait time for the \"pilot car\" in a construction zone where traffic has been reduced to one-way. Electrical Engineering Intern Garmin International May 2007  \u2013  August 2007  (4 months) This was my first internship with Garmin International. For this internship, my project was to work on a wireless link between sensors and the main hub for the marine team. The wireless protocol I used was called \"wireless ANT\" and is developed by Dynastream. I successfully got the link to work in our controlled workplace. I also performed a significant amount of range testing for the wireless mouse and remote. Electrical Engineering S and Y Industries May 2006  \u2013  August 2006  (4 months) For the first half of this internship, I acquired valuable hands-on experience and intimate knowledge by building products and soldering different components. For the second half of the internship, I worked in the QC department where I tested the final products and troubleshot the broken circuits. In this arena, I developed my basic logical troubleshooting skills that are still with me today.
