Graduate Research Intern Intel Corporation May 2012  \u2013  December 2012  (8 months) Bangalore My internship work involved optimizing the memory performance of multi-threaded workloads on Intel's server processors. I extended the existing cache dead block predictor algorithm to handle simultaneous multi-threading. I explored the design of a sharing-aware last-level cache dead block predictor scheme for server workloads. As part of this work I conducted a detailed characterization study of the applications and proposed a novel dead block predictor scheme to improve their performance. I had a chance to work with Intel's in-house architecture simulator. The work resulted in a patent.

Research Assistant University of Minnesota January 2009  \u2013  June 2014  (5 years 6 months) My research deals with various aspects of the memory characteristics of multi-threaded applications. In particular, I am interested in the performance and correctness issues of multi-threaded applications running on multi-core processors. As part of my research I explored the correctness issues during cross-ISA emulation of multi-threaded applications on multi-core processors. I worked on designing sharing-aware cache replacement policies for multi-threaded programs. I also worked on characterizing the performance of emerging multi-threaded workloads, and the effect of compiler optimizations on such programs. I have had a chance to work with a wide range of tools and simulators as part of my research. Graduate Research Intern Intel Corporation May 2012  \u2013  December 2012  (8 months) Bangalore My internship work involved optimizing the memory performance of multi-threaded workloads on Intel's server processors. I extended the existing cache dead block predictor algorithm to handle simultaneous multi-threading. I explored the design of a sharing-aware last-level cache dead block predictor scheme for server workloads. As part of this work I conducted a detailed characterization study of the applications and proposed a novel dead block predictor scheme to improve their performance. I had a chance to work with Intel's in-house architecture simulator. The work resulted in a patent.
