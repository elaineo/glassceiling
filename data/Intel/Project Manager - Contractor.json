I'm a middleman between development and management, responsible for software quality and account management.  \n \nI strongly believe that there\u2019s only one thing needed to change the world for better: EDUCATION.  \n \nProfessional background: I tried different roles through my career. At 14 I started from cleaning the factory floor around people programming PLC controllers. The next year I came back as a PLC programming assistant. I Studied in Poland and acquired BS degree in Computer Science. During studies I was a freelancer doing web design and development. I was a test Engineer for Symantec products and been to Iran as a telco backbone system analyst and developer as well as spent a while at a call center\u2019s channel development team. While working for Intel as an Education Ecosystem Manager for CEE I realized the importance of bringing technology to schools and education technology became the most important field I'm interested in. At Intellisense, I'm devoted to bringing highest quality education software to thousands of schools in the world.  \n \nPersonal: In private life, I enjoy all kinds of woodworking, especially giving new life to pieces found on the street or garage sales. I'm a djembe (what the heck is that? Google is your friend) player and hope to create a band with my sons in the future. Summary Too amateur to be a geek, too geek to be an amateur.
