Modeling ", "Summary Throughout my 10 year career I have primarily worked with mixed-signal System-on-Chips for low-power embedded applications. The devices I have worked on have found their way into portable MP3/Video players, GPS devices, smart phones, ebook readers, and more. \n \nMy personal experience is in silicon debug, mixed-signal IC design, hardware design, customer application support, and analog validation. \n \nFuture career goals include new opportunities in pre-silicon design/simulation or post-silicon validation. I acclimate quickly to new teams and situations and am a great self-learner. Specialties:I am extremely comfortable in a lab environment and use these skills in the post silicon world to hunt critical bugs. In addition to providing debug and high-speed probing solutions I am able to automate lab equipment (via Python) to perform high-volume characterization.
