Hundreds of students competed for a chance to be on the few official teams led by engineering companies such as Intel, Boeing, Ford, Chevron and Raytheon through quick interviews. The final teams competed to solve the engineering challenge presented to us with minimal budget and intense rounds of elevator pitches, presentations, prototype building and unexpected issues \"injected\" into the environment to cause the team to re-think the design.

Hundreds of students competed for a chance to be on the few official teams led by engineering companies such as Intel, Boeing, Ford, Chevron and Raytheon through quick interviews. The final teams competed to solve the engineering challenge presented to us with minimal budget and intense rounds of elevator pitches, presentations, prototype building and unexpected issues \"injected\" into the environment to cause the team to re-think the design.

", "Summary I am a seasoned Software Engineer that has been designing and developing software since 1995, primarily on the Microsoft stack. I started with Visual C++ 1.0, Visual Basic 3.0 (for Windows) and 1.0 (for DOS), and SQL Server 4.2. \n \nI have followed application development trends from client/server to n-tier to web to mobile to the cloud. Clients started thick, then went thin, then alternated several times between the two. Business logic migrated from stored procedures to COM components to services. Data modeling shifted from 3rd party tools to SQL database diagrams to ORMs. \n \nFor a good part of my career I was very active in the Microsoft certification community. From 1996 to 2010, I passed 32 exams and attained (and re-attained) the major developer and database certifications. In 2004 I became a Microsoft Certified Trainer. From 2005 to 2010, I taught 21 developer and database-oriented classes to 265 students, saving my company $435K. \n \nAfter acquiring vast experience developing enterprise applications and establishing a successful track record of solving complex problems, I am now squarely in the second half of my career. Though I no longer code as often, my project responsibilities have nonetheless increased by managing the project schedule, technical team, customers, and management. \n \nI have been employed by Intel since 2000, and most recently I joined the Internet of Things Group. I am currently part of the development team working on Retail Client Manager (intel.com/rcm), and I am having a lot of fun. I am not looking for any other opportunities at this time.
