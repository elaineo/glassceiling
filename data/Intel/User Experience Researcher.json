I love understanding what makes people tick, and as a college student, am incredibly aware of the rapidly intersecting spheres of social media and our day to day communication. Dating, finding a job, and making new friends now have completely new social rules with the creation of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other media outlets.  \n \nI want to understand those rules, and perhaps even create them. I hope to develop technologies that will allow the user to explore their connections with others, and understand the ways in which our social relationships may be bettered through social media outlets. \n \nA way in which I navigate my world is through the eyes of a poet. I have been writing since I was able to string together the alphabet as a child.Poetry and creative expression are integral components of my life. When I am not pursuing research for my Psychology and Sociology professors, I am acting as a team leader for Oberlin College's slam poetry team and club. I help writers across campus express their thoughts, feelings, and emotions through the poetic medium, and in doing so, work to bring my campus together through the power and catharsis of poetry. Through my poetry, I hope to ignite social change in communities across the world. Currently, I am pursing a project that will support economically under privileged girls aged 8-16 in writing poetry, as a way to build not only self esteem but community, which will eventually lead to incredible self empowerment.

By understanding people\u2019s mental models and how they make sense of the world, it helps identify new opportunities to design something that people would actually find valuable and meaningful.  \n \nUltimately, the decision to choose one product/service over another can partly be attributed to its features. However, there is more to consumer decision making than simply comparing product/services at the feature level. Oftentimes, the most influential factors shaping what and why we buy are our perceptions, goals, and values. For that reason, throughout my career and academic studies I have studied people from a multidisciplinary approach of psychology, economic, user experience, and human factors engineering.
