Founder | Researcher Dissect.pe July 2010  \u2013 Present (5 years 2 months) Dissect.pe is a malware research project, now in beta stage. \n \nThe idea of the project is to provide a free interface for malware analysis, similar to other existing projects, but with advances that will be announced when we start freely dissecting samples. \n \nFor now, the system has malware classification and is open for partnership with industry vendors and other projects for feed exchange. \n \nThe link for the project is: http://feeds.dissect.pe/ Organizer Hackers to Hackers Conference H2HC - Hackers to Hackers Conference January 2004  \u2013 Present (11 years 8 months) We are organizing since 2004 a security conference called Hackers to Hackers Conference (H2HC).  \n \nThis conference is increasing every year and is used as a powerful way of communication between high skilled security researchers in Brazil. \n \nMany new techniques, tools and vulnerabilities have been presented during the conference years.  \n \nAlso acting as a speaker, I presented about the follow topics: \n- Polymorphic attacks (where I presented the SCMorphism software that \"automagically\" generates polymorphic shellcodes)  \n- Kernel Rootkits x Application Layer Firewalls (with real sample using ISA Server 2004) \n- Syscall Proxying || Pivoting (where I showed a framework to be PRELOADED permiting you run any program in your own machine but in fact it was translated to the analysed machine) Senior Security Researcher RISE Security January 2004  \u2013 Present (11 years 8 months) Organization founded in 2004 by three brazilian security researchers specialized in vulnerability research, exploit development, source code auditing, reverse engineering, intrusion detection and computer forensics. The main objective is to evolve, ethically sharing the results with the security community. Research Assistant University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign July 2013  \u2013  December 2013  (6 months) Urbana-Champaign, Illinois Area While doing my PhD, I received a tuition and support from the university to perform research in the field of computer security and to give classes on reverse engineering in different curriculums.

Founded in 2004, we are a young and dynamic company whose constitution are computer security experts, from diverse backgrounds and geographies, with distinguished credentials and experience. \n \nIt is our aim to provide our clients with the most professional and competent expertise and services at the most reasonable rates so that they can achieve the highest returns on their information technology investment. \n \nOrganizationally, COSEINC is structured into 2 teams. They are the Advanced Malware Laboratory (AML) and the Vulnerability Research Laboratory (VRL).  \n \nAs for the VRL, this team is focus on discovering inherent vulnerabilities in software either due to bad development or weak implementation.

One such side-channel is the scan chain based Design-for-Test (DfT) infrastructure employed for thorough and faster testing of VLSI circuits. The PhD thesis first investigates the scan attack vulnerability of symmetric-key and public-key hardware implementations, and then presents suitable countermeasures to address the aforementioned trade-off between testability, security and test cost. The thesis presents scan attacks on hardware implementations of the symmetric-key block cipher AES and the public-key ciphers RSA and ECC in presence of advanced DfT structures. In addition, state-of-the-art power analysis side-channel and fault attack countermeasures are analyzed to evaluate whether they are suitable in warding off scan attacks. Another major contribution of the thesis is secure Cryptographic SoC Testing.
