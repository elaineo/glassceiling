Worked on a very cool concept of programmable Network Processors. Designed Intel IXP4XX network processor HSS firmware. Lead designer for Xscale application component such as OS layer. Managed SW/SV engineering teams to deliver quality solution for IXP4XX Xscale application layer. Managed subcontract situations (IPSec) and drove solutions to finish line. Managed various BSP and RTOS related projects. Managed teams that had zero overlap from timezone perspective. Product early architecture definition for next-gen Security Devices.  \n \nOur Network Processor solutions were ranked No.1 worldwide around 2002-2003 time frame with IXP425 peaking as a great choice for SOHO and wireless APs.
