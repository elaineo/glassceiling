BIOS Engineer Intel Corporation September 2011  \u2013 Present (4 years) Guadalajara Area, Mexico Develop and debug BIOS Firmware for validate the upcoming Intel server products. We work with the UEFI specification programming mainly in C but we use also assembler and ASL(ACPI) code. Part of our job is also to support internal and external customers with their BIOS development process.

Firmware Engineer Centro de Dise\u00f1o Electr\u00f3nico (ITESM) July 2006  \u2013  August 2007  (1 year 2 months) I worked for an electronic design center owned by the Tec de Monterrey which offers its services to the electronic industry, especially in the wireless communication area (based on the Intel/Marvel PXA270 microprocessor). Our team which is conformed by hardware and computer science specialists design custom products according with the specifications described by our customers. We select the components, design the PCB, assembly the PCB\u2019s programming the firmware and software that will be running in the systems and finally we test the system before the delivery. My principal function here is to develop or adapt the board support packages and develop the drivers for our platforms. These firmware allows our platforms to run WINCE.

Point of sales 4690 Operating system developer & support IBM Global Services Mexico May 2004  \u2013  August 2006  (2 years 4 months) Software Engineer, responsible for world wide support components of an IBM 4690 Operating system used in many retail stores such WAL-MART, KROGER etc. The code was written in C and assembler and it was designed for running in x86 platforms with special peripheral devices. The team modified the errors in the OS base code and particularly I attend the problems related with the following components: Support and development of new features related Data Distribution application, which is a combination of a driver and an application that distribute all the information in real-time between the store servers. Application software maintenance support, this application and its driver handle the updates of the operating system and the application that runs in the 4690OS.
