I have been in this position since 2007 and during this time I built the product development organization from the ground up, creating a top-flight, scalable development organization that varies between 50 and 100 team members depending on current projects. Our successes included cutting development time significantly through agile development; launching a new suite of analytics products which will generate significant sales in their first year; and rebuilding aging flagship product from ground up.  \n \nMy previous roles included serving as a Technical Project/Program Manager for Intel where I managed multiple large and complex projects leading teams of up to 40 and managing project budgets of up to $6M.  \n \nI thrive on the strategic aspects of my work because, for me, technology should always drive business success. The common thread that runs through my entire career is the ability to keep complex initiatives on track no matter how many challenges arise. My colleagues know me as a consummate problem-solver and I thoroughly enjoy working under pressure or facing challenges that have beaten others.  \n \nI have a documented history of delivering complex software projects on time and within budget and am known for my ability to turn around stalled projects. My manager has commented that the healthcare practice \u201ccould not operate without Rajesh's deep experience and understanding of technology\u201d and complimented my \u201calways calm, measured, and professional\u201d approach to problem-solving.  \n \nThis last compliment is especially meaningful to me because I take care to always respond calmly when problems arise, so that my team is able to function at their best.  \n \nI hold a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Engineering and a Masters degree in Management Studies.

Experience Director of Engineering Huron Consulting Group February 2007  \u2013 Present (8 years 7 months) Lake Oswego, Oregon I was recruited by Huron to build and lead the product development organization. I\u2019m accountable for project management, engineering management, QA, architecture and development infrastructure supporting the company\u2019s healthcare consulting practice. I develop the technology strategy and manage the full development lifecycle from conception to final delivery, working closely with business leaders.  \n \nWhen I was first hired, I faced the need to upgrade the technology infrastructure, rebuild a depleted team and implement a development methodology from scratch. \nSince that time, I have built top-performing, highly skilled and scalable technology organization whose size has ranged from 50 to 100 in recent years, implemented agile development methodology cutting development time and improving predictability, and significantly upgraded the technology infrastructure.  \n \nI have also grown revenues by enabling the launch of 5 new analytics products, which are expected to generate multimillion-dollar revenues. Project Manager (Consultant) Comotiv Systems 2006  \u2013  2006  (less than a year) Portland, Oregon This company developed online collaboration tools and hired me on a consulting basis to turn around a stalled product development project. My challenge was to identify and resolve the issues, and deliver the product to market.  \n \nHaving conducted a full analysis of the situation, I removed multiple roadblocks, improved communication, developed a new project plan, and gained buy-in from all stakeholders. \nAs a result of this work, the company delivered a high-quality product on time and within budget. InfoTech Manager Intel Corporation 2005  \u2013  2006  (1 year) Portland, Oregon As Infotech manager, I led the development of custom software products using Microsoft Technologies such as .NET, SQL Server, etc.  \n \nInitially I inherited an under-performing .NET development team suffering from low moral and high attrition rates, but through improved training and communication, the team were transformed. They became a cohesive, high-performing group that hit 100% of their release dates. Technical Project/Program Manager Intel Corporation 2000  \u2013  2005  (5 years) Portland, Oregon In this role, I led project teams of up to 40 with budgets of up to $6M, frequently salvaging troubled projects or leading complex, multi-faceted initiatives.  \n \nSuccesses included planning/managing development of a new content management system, following the failure of two previous attempts; leading the development of a sales force productivity portal, and playing a key role in transitioning several large development programs (cumulative budgets of up to $100M) to India. I developed offshore working models and performance metrics, led pilot projects and helped to grow the Intel Indian group to over 1,000 employees with very strong performance. Software Engineer/Consultant Northwest Software 1998  \u2013  2000  (2 years) Portland, Oregon In this position, I worked as a consultant for Intel Corporation, successfully delivering several software development projects.
