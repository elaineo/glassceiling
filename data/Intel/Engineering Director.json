Experience Product Development Engineering Director Intel Corporation April 2015  \u2013 Present (5 months) Penang, Malaysia While I continue to serve as the Principal Technologist for Intel Custom Foundry, I am managing the ICF Product Development Engineering Team in Penang. My primary role is to hire and grow the organization, and align the Penang organization with its counterpart in US. Principal Technologist Intel Corporation November 2013  \u2013 Present (1 year 10 months) Santa Clara I am a technical individual contributor focusing on test and manufacturing solutions for the Intel Custom Foundry customers by working with Intel Technology Development organizations. Engineering Manager Intel Corporation June 1988  \u2013  October 2013  (25 years 5 months) Santa Clara I started in Intel as a Senior Product Development Engineer (PDE) on the 80286 product family. Though the product family was a legacy product family that had been in production for few years, I was able to dramatically improve the product manufacturing performance in yield, frequency binsplit and test time thru systematic problem solving and process target tuning. Over time, I had the opportunities to make same and extended impacts to many flagship Intel microprocessors including 80486, Pentium processors, Itanium processors and Xeon processors. The PDE role provided me great opportunities to collaborate with wide varieties of functional organizations (Device Design, Product Quality and Reliability, Technology Development, Factory network, Planning, Marketing, product validation, etc) and made direct impact to Intel's top-line and bottom-line performance positively.  \n \nBesides the technical aspects of my responsibilities in directing, executing and delivering manufacturing development capabilities, I was responsible to grow the PDE organization to 60+ people thru hiring, training and integration. Besides directing and growing my own PDE Team, I was successful to form an impactful body with all Intel PDE Team Leaders to promote and grow the PDE careers and visibility within Intel.  \n \nI earned numerous Intel Recognition Awards thru my 25+ years in Intel Corporations including two most prestige team awards in Intel, the Intel Achievement Award. Assistant Engineering Manager RCL Semiconductors September 1979  \u2013  February 1988  (8 years 6 months) Hong Kong RCL was among the first three wafer fabrication startups in Hong Kong in late 70's. I was among the first 10 engineers being hired to get the factory and process started about 2 years before the factory was running. The exposure I got from the early phase was extensive ranging from factory facility requirements and installation, equipment installation and acceptance to process recipe development and optimization. My initial focus was in the photolithography (or masking - imaging and wet etching) and later extended to overall process development thru SUPREM simulation to actual experimentations. A process for high voltage (18V) devices was developed successfully with the same equipment that were used for low voltage (1.5V) devices. The last position I held was the Assistant Fab Process Engineering Manager with 3 engineers reporting to me. My responsibilities included all engineering activities in photolithography and development of new process recipes, plus managing manufacturing performance on products. \n \nKey Accomplishment: Contributed to a high tech startup from beginning to full production.

Principal Technologist Intel Corporation November 2013  \u2013 Present (1 year 10 months) Santa Clara I am a technical individual contributor focusing on test and manufacturing solutions for the Intel Custom Foundry customers by working with Intel Technology Development organizations.

Engineering Manager Intel Corporation June 1988  \u2013  October 2013  (25 years 5 months) Santa Clara I started in Intel as a Senior Product Development Engineer (PDE) on the 80286 product family. Though the product family was a legacy product family that had been in production for few years, I was able to dramatically improve the product manufacturing performance in yield, frequency binsplit and test time thru systematic problem solving and process target tuning. Over time, I had the opportunities to make same and extended impacts to many flagship Intel microprocessors including 80486, Pentium processors, Itanium processors and Xeon processors. The PDE role provided me great opportunities to collaborate with wide varieties of functional organizations (Device Design, Product Quality and Reliability, Technology Development, Factory network, Planning, Marketing, product validation, etc) and made direct impact to Intel's top-line and bottom-line performance positively.  \n \nBesides the technical aspects of my responsibilities in directing, executing and delivering manufacturing development capabilities, I was responsible to grow the PDE organization to 60+ people thru hiring, training and integration. Besides directing and growing my own PDE Team, I was successful to form an impactful body with all Intel PDE Team Leaders to promote and grow the PDE careers and visibility within Intel.  \n \nI earned numerous Intel Recognition Awards thru my 25+ years in Intel Corporations including two most prestige team awards in Intel, the Intel Achievement Award.

Assistant Engineering Manager RCL Semiconductors September 1979  \u2013  February 1988  (8 years 6 months) Hong Kong RCL was among the first three wafer fabrication startups in Hong Kong in late 70's. I was among the first 10 engineers being hired to get the factory and process started about 2 years before the factory was running. The exposure I got from the early phase was extensive ranging from factory facility requirements and installation, equipment installation and acceptance to process recipe development and optimization. My initial focus was in the photolithography (or masking - imaging and wet etching) and later extended to overall process development thru SUPREM simulation to actual experimentations. A process for high voltage (18V) devices was developed successfully with the same equipment that were used for low voltage (1.5V) devices. The last position I held was the Assistant Fab Process Engineering Manager with 3 engineers reporting to me. My responsibilities included all engineering activities in photolithography and development of new process recipes, plus managing manufacturing performance on products. \n \nKey Accomplishment: Contributed to a high tech startup from beginning to full production.
