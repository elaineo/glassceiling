Experience RET Design Engineer Intel Corporation September 2013  \u2013 Present (2 years) Hillsboro, OR Research Assistant University of Wisconsin-Madison September 2007  \u2013  August 2013  (6 years) Madison, WI My research in the group of Juan de Pablo employs coarse-grain molecular models, in concert with advanced sampling methods, to probe questions in the realm of biophysics. My focus is on biological methods for confining DNA. As a semi-flexible polyelectrolyte, DNA can be difficult to compact and yet, in every organism and virus, volume compaction of up to three orders of magnitude are common. We study two representative systems. In the case of dsDNA bacteriophage (viruses that infect bacteria), a protein motor actively packages the DNA and provides the work required for compaction. In the case of eukaryotes, DNA is packaged with the help of a protein building blocks. These proteins, histones, when complexed with DNA, create nucleosomes. The organization of nucleosomes in the genome has important consequences and we can use our computational tools to study the behavior of these building blocks for genome compaction.
