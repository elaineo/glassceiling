That analysis helped define the next few years\u2019 focus for pre-sales support tools. \n \nWhile providing sabbatical coverage for a colleague, David joined an inflight project to enable consumer webticketing and used his attention to detail to identify numerous technical gaps with the planned deployment.

David did this by navigating the organizational dynamics, identifying pockets of entrenched resistance, and then using data and reason to demonstrate how his proposal best met the business and technical needs of the organization. In David's role as the Scrum Product Owner for the logistics team, David provided structure and created the action plan the team used to move from relative chaos to a functional, integrated, and enterprise-scale solution for forward and reverse direct-to-consumer logistics.

As a result, no email outages were recorded due to EIM deficiencies and ~100 email addresses were eliminated from production, reducing administrative costs and environment complexity, setting the stage for success in future efforts of additional simplification. David provided critical troubleshooting skills and knowledge to the production support teams supporting email infrastructure during and after production outages within related systems. \n \nDavid designed a solution using existing internal tools to eliminate the use of a third party email auto-response system, saving Intel $162k annually, vastly improving IT's responsiveness to new configuration requirements, and eliminating the 12+ multi-user outages annually which were associated with the 3rd party solution. \n \nIn 2010, David received an Intel IT Excellence Award for his work on the EIM project.
