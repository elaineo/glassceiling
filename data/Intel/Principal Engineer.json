Experience Principal Engineer - Lead Server Debug Architect Qualcomm November 2013  \u2013 Present (1 year 10 months) Raleigh, NC - Debug Architect for server processors. This included industry standard as well as custom solutions that were needed for larger scale designs. Worked on all aspects of the design phase including architecture and specification, clock specification, design, integration, timing closure, post-silicon tools, and silicon bringup. Debug Architecture Lead (Principal Engineer) Intel Corporation January 2011  \u2013  November 2013  (2 years 11 months) Hillsboro, OR Lead architect and development lead on the central debug architecture for SoC's that supports observation of HW, SW, code flow, performance, and power monitoring. Team provided both the HW architecture, portions of the design, validation as well as much of the software infrastructure that gets distributed to internal teams and external tool vendors. Architecture is being used across phones to server designs.  \n \nLed the cross-Intel Debug Tools working group that set the direction for which tools should be developed and used across the post-silicon validation and debug teams. SoC Enabling Group - Hardware Debug Architecture (Principal Engineer) Intel Corporation August 2007  \u2013  January 2011  (3 years 6 months) Hillsboro, OR Lead architect that drove architecture and standards across SoC development teams around hardware debug and trace. This involved converging multiple disparate implementations into one fabric and set of IP blocks to be used across all of the designs.  \n \nPrototyped and deployed automated methods for hardware debug insertion for IP's. Obtained funding and support from global DA team to scale across hundreds of IP's and all SoC projects. \n \nDeveloped a post-silicon tool flow that was automated based on the design insertion tools that were built.
