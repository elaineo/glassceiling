Digital Electronics Design Engineer Moog Inc. January 2007  \u2013  December 2009  (3 years) Salt Lake City, Utah Specific Job Title: C-Roll Senior Engineering Specialist, Electrical Flight Control Systems. \nThe aircraft programs on which I worked included the following contributions. \n \nIndividually and as a part of the team, my contributions enabled the Vibration Control Actuation System (VCAS) program to create successful products. For example: \nI researched and developed the digital clock circuit design on the motherboard used in the VCAS for the Sikorsky Seahawk helicopter. \nI also designed a \"rigid-flex\" VCAS circuit board, which eliminated difficult manual assembly steps. \n \nI also worked on Boeing Aircraft flight control projects as a Verification and Validation Team Engineer and as a Design Engineer. For example: \nI created a schematic for a power supply board slated for use on the new Boeing 787-8 motor control system.  \nI performed electronic validation reviews on the Boeing 787-8 motor control system.  \nI authored derived-requirement justifications for a new digital platform to be used on the Boeing 747-8. Digital Electronics Design Engineer Moog Aircraft Group January 1998  \u2013  December 2006  (9 years) Salt Lake City, Utah Specific Job Title: C-Roll Senior Engineering Specialist, Electrical Flight Control Systems. \nI developed digital circuits for the \u201cCommand\u201d control board that positioned the secondary flight control surfaces on the $22 million Hawker 4000 (Horizon) business jet. I faced several challenges that helped grow my engineering skills.  \nFor example, at Moog, I needed to design a way our flight control system could communicate with the other flight computers on the jet. To solve this, I designed a communication bus-master device, which I embedded into a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). This design controls data messages throughout the Hawker aircraft. I then modified the VHDL code used in this device to fix bugs and to add functionality. The result was an exceptionally robust and reliable product that can be easily adapted to the different needs of the flap, spoiler, and stabilizer surfaces. The end products qualified for the highest level of FAA system approval. Thus my work resulted in a reliable flight-worthy FPGA-based communication system that along with the rest of the fight command system helped the Hawker 4000 get FAA type certification. \n \nMy years at Moog helped hone many of my skills and aptitudes that are transferable from aircraft component design to other industries. For example, after I designed the bus-master, I gave a presentation that taught the concepts of my complex communication device to other engineers. This enabled them to perform the appropriate tests on my bus-master design. I made sure the device was completely documented so that later revisions if any could be more easily made. I was the go-to-person when manufacturing engineers needed help with the production of the product. \n \nI also created programming methods and scripts that loaded Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) with the logic that controls the aircraft, substantially reducing errors and training requirements; these scripts increased technician efficiency and accuracy by 40%.
