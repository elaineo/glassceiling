Experience Open Network Platform Software Applications Engineer Intel Corporation June 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 3 months) Restructuring the Intel ONPs to support multiple OEMs. This includes redesigning the ONPs, and Open Network Software (ONS), developing and improving the performance and easiness of incorporating the technologies with our OEMs.  \n \nStreamlining the process of development, testing and delivery of the ONPs & ONS internally. The streamlining includes redesigning the installation procedure on OEMs products to ease.  \n \nDefining and designing the ONPs & ONS interfaces to increase the engagement of third-party SDN & NFV application vendors with Intel products.  \n \nEngaging TEMs, OEMs, IHVs, and ISVs within the market ecosystem to enable them to design their solutions and go to market on the Intel ONP Server and Switch Reference Designs for Telecom, Cloud and Enterprise. \n \nOwning and managing design-in support from initial customer opportunity discovery to end product qualification and debugging for the Intel ONP Reference Designs and their system-level ingredients (software, processors, chipsets, switch, NIC).  \n \nSupporting sales and marketing teams to engage with customers on technical solutions that best fulfill their requirements.  \n \nWorking directly with architects and engineering to ensure a complete platform solution is defined and enabled for Intel's customers to use during their development cycle.  \n \nOwning and driving the definition and development of platform technical documentation for Intel's customers. This will also require direct engagement with product marketing to develop customer-ready collateral and messages.  \n \nTraining and enabling field sales teams to achieve design wins on ONP as reference architecture for Intel products and solutions.  \nPartnering closely with peer silicon and software PAE teams within CSIG (ND, CID, SD) to deliver a single point of contact to OEMs to ensure end to end technical support across the platform.  \n \nNavigating ambiguous and dynamic SDN/NFV market environments to drive program clarity and design win focus on Intel ONP Senior Cloud Engineer Intel Corporation February 2009  \u2013  June 2014  (5 years 5 months) HIllsboro, OR Lead engineer for enterprise wide Virtualization Factory inclusive of standard P2Vs (Physical to Virtual Migration) as well as highly complex, large, white glove conversion projects. Inclusive of all engineering, testing, and implementation of the P2V and V2V (virtual to virtual) process, both technical and process related.  \n \nLeader for cloud team that accomplished one of the most critical CIO's goals which was reaching a share of market of 90% virtual servers in Intel\u2019s data centers. Rick leadership and technical skills including the P2V/V2V/Cloning/Migration efforts were a huge factor that enabled the cloud team to reach IT\u2019s goal. Over 10,000 physical servers were converted to virtual as a result in 12 major datacenters worldwide. \n \nLead project for DMZ/Secure P2V conversions. The scope of this project was much larger than for internal due to additional technical complexity. Rick tested/configured/documented/created BKMs/trained and lead the effort to successfully complete the project on time with no issue.
