Debug Architecture Lead (Principal Engineer) Intel Corporation January 2011  \u2013  November 2013  (2 years 11 months) Hillsboro, OR Lead architect and development lead on the central debug architecture for SoC's that supports observation of HW, SW, code flow, performance, and power monitoring. Team provided both the HW architecture, portions of the design, validation as well as much of the software infrastructure that gets distributed to internal teams and external tool vendors. Architecture is being used across phones to server designs.  \n \nLed the cross-Intel Debug Tools working group that set the direction for which tools should be developed and used across the post-silicon validation and debug teams. SoC Enabling Group - Hardware Debug Architecture (Principal Engineer) Intel Corporation August 2007  \u2013  January 2011  (3 years 6 months) Hillsboro, OR Lead architect that drove architecture and standards across SoC development teams around hardware debug and trace. This involved converging multiple disparate implementations into one fabric and set of IP blocks to be used across all of the designs.  \n \nPrototyped and deployed automated methods for hardware debug insertion for IP's. Obtained funding and support from global DA team to scale across hundreds of IP's and all SoC projects. \n \nDeveloped a post-silicon tool flow that was automated based on the design insertion tools that were built. Tools could be done in a matter of weeks (versus many quarters) with massive improvements in quality.  \n \nLed the team that supported debug tools and power-on's for multiple SoC's. Personal hands on experience for many of these projects.  \n \nLed team to develop a debug automation prototype that was used later on to quickly test out features at power on. Still technical advisor for this program today.  \nProvided hands on debug and support to product teams for multiple products.
