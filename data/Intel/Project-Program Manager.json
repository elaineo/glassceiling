Team Member Folsom Fire Dept Community Emergency Response Team May 2011  \u2013 Present (4 years 4 months) Folsom, CA The mission for the Folsom C.E.R.T volunteer program is to respond when disaster strikes overwhelming local Fire and Police resources such as Floods, Earthquakes, Wild Fires, Multi Casualty Incidents and Homeland Security Response involving acts of Terrorism. Business Analyst / Project Manager American Pacific Mortgage August 2014  \u2013  January 2015  (6 months) 3000 Lava Ridge Court Roseville CA Part of Project Management is to take determined, meaningful steps in accomplishing the goals of the organization. The best use a methodical approach to run the organization and APM took the extraordinary steps to become more disciplined in their approach to meeting the goals of the organization.I was lucky enough to have been a part of it. They pride themselves on ever increasing the efficiency of the organizations and IT played a big role in the endeavor. As new and updated applications were evolving I drove implementation through the industry standard project methodology including requirements gathering, scheduling and implementing to the strategy. In one instance, a department within the company needed to eliminate errors and increase productivity in an area they were performing manual data manipulation. I gathered data and process requirements and drove the effort between the application vendor, internal stakeholders and IT resources to automate the process of manually moving data from one application to another, saving nearly 4 hours of labor per day and eliminating data entry errors. IT Program Manager Intel Corporation March 2012  \u2013  June 2014  (2 years 4 months) Folsom CA While there are a tremendous amount of \u201cI\u201ds in the following paragraphs, rest assured there were many mentors which helped guide me along the way. In turn, I tried to impart a little humor as well as the organizational skills I learnt onto the teams I managed. These teams were the true reason for my success; I was but the conductor.  \n \n- My key responsibilities were for team management and life cycle of projects and capabilities in alignment with strategic solutions. While I have experience in Open Source OS such as Unix and Linux, I needed to form a technical view of Intel\u2019s Cloud Computing Platform, Open Stack, and in turn an easy to digest visual aid for the project team to understand how their piece fits into the bigger puzzle.  \n- I also added to my Project Management toolbox by taking Agile and tool training and becoming certified as a Scrum Master for the Manageability and Monitoring Tools team. I collaborated with others to develop a Configuration Management architectural strategy in alignment with Intel\u2019s Open Source Cloud and Service Management conducting an industry scan, cost of change analysis and prioritized requirements across domains. I also completed a security review for the tools within the scope of the team and found the tools like Nagios, Ceilometer, Heat and Puppet were themselves secured by SSL however the communications between the tools were not. Even code storage on GitHub was analyzed. This led to an even larger analysis within the entire program that found similar gaps. \n- I increased the levels of Quality in the support for Java product management at a time where there were multiple Security Excursions and disjointed efforts in the programing community. I took the role and represented the team by managing the deliverables within the Excursions and general testing roadmap of the Java family of products. I also chartered a dialogue with software developers for the promotion of Java application programming standards. IT Program Manager / Operations Manager Intel Corporation March 2010  \u2013  March 2012  (2 years 1 month) Folsom, CA - I completed a 3-year tour as a key player in the development Intel's Active Management Technology, winning multiple awards. I prep'ed for migrating to the next generation of Infrastructure while transitioning the Program. I also developed the Services Catalog and worked to define Manageability related objects within the Infrastructure Support Framework.  \n- I also was the Security Enterprise Rights Management project manager preparing for the implementation of externally facing ERM capabilities in accordance with Intel PLC. \n- I transitioned to Operations Manager, where the key was to interact with partner IT teams to track issues and drive efficient handoffs of tasks between the groups. I managed the agenda and collateral associated with status update meetings. In doing so, I had the opportunity to increase my expertise in the enterprise. \n- Additionally, I coordinated a variety of reports and processes to streamline the operations of the organization. I also developed tools using Excel and SQL for spending tracking, managed department level goals and progress tracking, and initiated a resource tracking plan. This included a plan to clean up our escalation queue data (Service Now migration) and implemented monthly reviews of performance to Service Level Agreements (SLA). \n- I completed a 6-month rotation as a First Line Manager in Security Engineering and completed all 2012 Finance Plan. I was instrumental in implementing a major tool license agreement that had languished for 1+ years; completed general team management though MBO, performance management and development. \n- I initiated a rotation as Operations Manager for a 270-person software team. I oversaw headcount allocations, financial and performance to Plan of Record (POR). I volunteering and implementing a Leadership Development program, scheduled 360 reviews for 50 managers and hosted brown bags on analyzing and acting on the feedback. IT Program Manager Intel Corporation March 2008  \u2013  March 2010  (2 years 1 month) Folsom, CA - While I continued my Program Management work to improve and implement iAMT, I also became the Program Manager responsible for the life cycle management of Provisioning and Compliance product capabilities and responsibilities included development of roadmap and execution of tactical and strategic solutions for business partner engagements. This included migrating physical Windows servers to the VMWare virtual environment through data created for physical servers, its role, prioritization tracking for waivers to the policy. \n- I Also accepted a sabbatical coverage within Intel IT Operations. This included all aspects of ownership of the Configuration Management Database (CMDB), aligning objectives and roadmaps and managing monthly releases. \n- I also assumed the role of managing the internal Service Management team and drove cross-organization discussions with engineering and the architecture group to develop appropriate Security and Manageability Services to ensure proper alignment with the Infrastructure Services Framework. I drove the completion of tasks with the Service Management group for the Manageability and Security Services through the completion of the Service Definition and Taxonomy for the IT Services Catalog. It included the planning and completion of Incident, Problem and Major Incident within the tool associated with the effort. \n- I also wanted to role model my continual improvement proficiency by passing the Project Management Institute's Project Management Professional (PMP) certification and demonstrating adherence to industry standard management of projects by effectively running multiple projects at one time, completing them within the allotted throughput time and without budget excursions. These projects included the influence and management of resources across matrixed organizations where a continuous process was in place to communication to functional managers. IT Program Manager Intel Corporation March 2005  \u2013  March 2008  (3 years 1 month) Folsom, CA - A key risk associated with Systems Management tools is they sit above the Operating System (OS). With my background in Manageability, I had participated in discussions with the hardware developers to create a Manageability Engine on a chip. This would be a key ingredient in the client platform and I became the Project Manager to implement this new capability internally within Intel called Intel Active Management Technology (iAMT). Sitting at the hardware level below the OS would allow the management of the device even if the OS were in a failed state and lowering the cost of support when failure occurred. \n- Since the technology did not exist, we had to use experimental equipment to complete even basic testing. What began as a simple POC became a Program where I managed teams through the analysis of the ecosystem and requirements gathering process and implementation of the Windows infrastructure. I developed a cross team effort to overcome key security issues and worked with Finance to develop a reusable model for estimating Net Present Value (NPV). These efforts culminated in the Intel IT Excellence Award, for the exemplary work across organizations and geographic regions. \n- I played a key role in developing better alignment of IT and Intel product designs during planning sessions. I also facilitated product change requests as well as worked directly with AMT chip designers. My team won numerous awards in recognizing their work for showing agility such as a project to put several hundred AMT enabled systems in Training Rooms. In helping raise the awareness of AMT within Intel, I presented to numerous groups and published articles on AMT providing in-depth expertise to external customers. This included collateral and Pod Casts and resulted in the Sales and Marketing identifying $1.2M in direct sales through my influence. This led to an Intel IT Achievement Award (IT\u2019s highest honor). Global IT Project Manager Intel Corporation March 2003  \u2013  March 2005  (2 years 1 month) Folsom, CA - While I have always had an inner desire for continuous learning, Intel the term \u201cRaising the Bar\u201d was embedded in their DNA. I had shown increased understanding of a large global organization and emerging technologies so I was put to the test as I began taking on Programs and Projects of increased scope and complexity that spanned both geographic and organizational exposure. Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) was making its way to the US from Europe and as an agent of change, I was instrumental in organizing materials and began educating the division on ITIL Foundations. To enhance the effectiveness of my influence through presentations I became an Intel Presentations Instructor. Because of my duties on the Asset Management team, I also began working to integrate Service Management methodologies into our group and drove the completion of a Data Dictionary for use within the Configuration Management Database (CMDB). I also participated in the selection process and testing of the Service Management tools, settling on the product Service Now. This continued growth was also instrumental in joining the IT@Intel, a group dedicated to helping other companies understand the complexities of the compute environments and I traveled and presented to the first of many organizations on ITIL and Asset and Configuration Management. This period was also when I would increase my influence by providing coverage as a First Line Manager. As such, I managed finances and developed technical resources to hit the bull\u2019s eye on current assignments as well as to look up and determine where they want to go in their careers. System Engineer Intel Corporation July 2000  \u2013  March 2003  (2 years 9 months) Folsom, CA - Intel was a company with over 100,000 compute devices at the time and it was imperative to have accurate data regarding those devices. Adding to the complexity is existing in over 120 countries. As such, a system was needed that could gather data regarding the as is state and have the ability to adjust the state to a known gold state. I owned the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) infrastructure including roadmap and development. I managed the project and redesigned the environment to gain efficiencies in data collection by shrinking the site complexity and develop small site architecture to include costs of slow links into consideration. This also included integration into Microsoft\u2019s Active Directory where I developed scripts to minimize the overhead of the SMS agents on the client systems. A system for Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity was developed and put to the test when both the NIMDA and Code Red viruses emerged into the environment. Custom patches to eradicate the viruses were designed and the system was used to implement corrective scripts into the environment. Because of the nature of that data, I become the technical adviser to the Asset Management team and one of the first data driven efforts to map compute lifecycle began. Systems Monitoring was also maturing during this time and I worked with the Service Desk to understand Events and pare down the Alerts to actionable tasks. Key to the efforts was the ability to reach across geographic distance through trips to Asia to educate the local support base as well as gain cooperative support for the activities. This also included reaching across technical boundaries by bringing the right resources together and work to accomplish the goals of the projects. Operations Management / Manageability Specialist Aventis May 1995  \u2013  July 2000  (5 years 3 months) Kansas City, Missouri Area Large organizations must rely on automation and management tools for watching and correcting issues in the environment. Aventis was no different. I played two roles in the years I was there; Network / Data Center Operations Management and Systems Engineer for manageability products. When I was hired, the then Network Operations Center (NOC) Service Desk was an 8x5 operation. For properly supporting the plant activities, we needed to broaden our support so I moved it to a 24x7x365 operation. To gain further efficiencies we then merged the NOC with Data Center Operations where I managed 15 operators. Our scope included transactions and database management on an IBM Mainframe along with both IT infrastructure (Windows and Novell networks), storage and backup, Cisco network devices as well as very high-end printers for FDA documentation. The 15 operators consisted of both internal as well as contract labor and my role was to ensure proper resourcing, hiring (and firing) and Single Point of Contact for escalations.  \n \nI also took over the Systems Engineering role for the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) where I managed a major upgrade that would allow us to develop patches for Y2K compliance. While Aventis was a multi-site environment, each site was autonomous. In supporting the new SMS infrastructure, I found it difficult to reference the other engineers as their SMS sites were configured differently. I subsequently started a program to migrate all systems to a managed configuration, allowing us to back up each other. As part of another merger, I designed and installed an SMS environment in the new headquarters with the ability to manage all sites from a single point. Engineering US Connect 1992  \u2013  1995  (3 years) It is the goal of any organization to provide their service or product in the most efficient manner. Many Small to Medium Businesses are not of size to afford dedicated resources to handle some of the aspects of the running the organization. This is where companies such as US Connect come into play. They (US Connect) provided IT Training and Services to such organizations. To be the most successful, one must learn to understand not only the technical issues, but also how they influence the business. While I understood Client / Server and Windows x86 platforms, I had begun to use increasing communications skills to find the right people who can clearly explain the business challenge and influence the decision makers to get to the gist of the business challenge, and in turn help the technical resources with tactical task completion.

In turn, I tried to impart a little humor as well as the organizational skills I learnt onto the teams I managed. These teams were the true reason for my success; I was but the conductor.  \n \n- My key responsibilities were for team management and life cycle of projects and capabilities in alignment with strategic solutions. While I have experience in Open Source OS such as Unix and Linux, I needed to form a technical view of Intel\u2019s Cloud Computing Platform, Open Stack, and in turn an easy to digest visual aid for the project team to understand how their piece fits into the bigger puzzle.  \n- I also added to my Project Management toolbox by taking Agile and tool training and becoming certified as a Scrum Master for the Manageability and Monitoring Tools team. I collaborated with others to develop a Configuration Management architectural strategy in alignment with Intel\u2019s Open Source Cloud and Service Management conducting an industry scan, cost of change analysis and prioritized requirements across domains. I also completed a security review for the tools within the scope of the team and found the tools like Nagios, Ceilometer, Heat and Puppet were themselves secured by SSL however the communications between the tools were not. Even code storage on GitHub was analyzed. This led to an even larger analysis within the entire program that found similar gaps. \n- I increased the levels of Quality in the support for Java product management at a time where there were multiple Security Excursions and disjointed efforts in the programing community. I took the role and represented the team by managing the deliverables within the Excursions and general testing roadmap of the Java family of products. I also chartered a dialogue with software developers for the promotion of Java application programming standards.

IT Program Manager Intel Corporation March 2005  \u2013  March 2008  (3 years 1 month) Folsom, CA - A key risk associated with Systems Management tools is they sit above the Operating System (OS). With my background in Manageability, I had participated in discussions with the hardware developers to create a Manageability Engine on a chip. This would be a key ingredient in the client platform and I became the Project Manager to implement this new capability internally within Intel called Intel Active Management Technology (iAMT). Sitting at the hardware level below the OS would allow the management of the device even if the OS were in a failed state and lowering the cost of support when failure occurred. \n- Since the technology did not exist, we had to use experimental equipment to complete even basic testing. What began as a simple POC became a Program where I managed teams through the analysis of the ecosystem and requirements gathering process and implementation of the Windows infrastructure. I developed a cross team effort to overcome key security issues and worked with Finance to develop a reusable model for estimating Net Present Value (NPV). These efforts culminated in the Intel IT Excellence Award, for the exemplary work across organizations and geographic regions. \n- I played a key role in developing better alignment of IT and Intel product designs during planning sessions. I also facilitated product change requests as well as worked directly with AMT chip designers. My team won numerous awards in recognizing their work for showing agility such as a project to put several hundred AMT enabled systems in Training Rooms. In helping raise the awareness of AMT within Intel, I presented to numerous groups and published articles on AMT providing in-depth expertise to external customers. This included collateral and Pod Casts and resulted in the Sales and Marketing identifying $1.2M in direct sales through my influence. This led to an Intel IT Achievement Award (IT\u2019s highest honor).

Global IT Project Manager Intel Corporation March 2003  \u2013  March 2005  (2 years 1 month) Folsom, CA - While I have always had an inner desire for continuous learning, Intel the term \u201cRaising the Bar\u201d was embedded in their DNA. I had shown increased understanding of a large global organization and emerging technologies so I was put to the test as I began taking on Programs and Projects of increased scope and complexity that spanned both geographic and organizational exposure. Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) was making its way to the US from Europe and as an agent of change, I was instrumental in organizing materials and began educating the division on ITIL Foundations. To enhance the effectiveness of my influence through presentations I became an Intel Presentations Instructor. Because of my duties on the Asset Management team, I also began working to integrate Service Management methodologies into our group and drove the completion of a Data Dictionary for use within the Configuration Management Database (CMDB). I also participated in the selection process and testing of the Service Management tools, settling on the product Service Now. This continued growth was also instrumental in joining the IT@Intel, a group dedicated to helping other companies understand the complexities of the compute environments and I traveled and presented to the first of many organizations on ITIL and Asset and Configuration Management. This period was also when I would increase my influence by providing coverage as a First Line Manager. As such, I managed finances and developed technical resources to hit the bull\u2019s eye on current assignments as well as to look up and determine where they want to go in their careers.

System Engineer Intel Corporation July 2000  \u2013  March 2003  (2 years 9 months) Folsom, CA - Intel was a company with over 100,000 compute devices at the time and it was imperative to have accurate data regarding those devices. Adding to the complexity is existing in over 120 countries. As such, a system was needed that could gather data regarding the as is state and have the ability to adjust the state to a known gold state. I owned the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) infrastructure including roadmap and development. I managed the project and redesigned the environment to gain efficiencies in data collection by shrinking the site complexity and develop small site architecture to include costs of slow links into consideration. This also included integration into Microsoft\u2019s Active Directory where I developed scripts to minimize the overhead of the SMS agents on the client systems. A system for Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity was developed and put to the test when both the NIMDA and Code Red viruses emerged into the environment. Custom patches to eradicate the viruses were designed and the system was used to implement corrective scripts into the environment. Because of the nature of that data, I become the technical adviser to the Asset Management team and one of the first data driven efforts to map compute lifecycle began. Systems Monitoring was also maturing during this time and I worked with the Service Desk to understand Events and pare down the Alerts to actionable tasks. Key to the efforts was the ability to reach across geographic distance through trips to Asia to educate the local support base as well as gain cooperative support for the activities. This also included reaching across technical boundaries by bringing the right resources together and work to accomplish the goals of the projects.

Operations Management / Manageability Specialist Aventis May 1995  \u2013  July 2000  (5 years 3 months) Kansas City, Missouri Area Large organizations must rely on automation and management tools for watching and correcting issues in the environment. Aventis was no different. I played two roles in the years I was there; Network / Data Center Operations Management and Systems Engineer for manageability products. When I was hired, the then Network Operations Center (NOC) Service Desk was an 8x5 operation. For properly supporting the plant activities, we needed to broaden our support so I moved it to a 24x7x365 operation. To gain further efficiencies we then merged the NOC with Data Center Operations where I managed 15 operators. Our scope included transactions and database management on an IBM Mainframe along with both IT infrastructure (Windows and Novell networks), storage and backup, Cisco network devices as well as very high-end printers for FDA documentation. The 15 operators consisted of both internal as well as contract labor and my role was to ensure proper resourcing, hiring (and firing) and Single Point of Contact for escalations.  \n \nI also took over the Systems Engineering role for the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) where I managed a major upgrade that would allow us to develop patches for Y2K compliance. While Aventis was a multi-site environment, each site was autonomous. In supporting the new SMS infrastructure, I found it difficult to reference the other engineers as their SMS sites were configured differently. I subsequently started a program to migrate all systems to a managed configuration, allowing us to back up each other. As part of another merger, I designed and installed an SMS environment in the new headquarters with the ability to manage all sites from a single point.

Engineering US Connect 1992  \u2013  1995  (3 years) It is the goal of any organization to provide their service or product in the most efficient manner. Many Small to Medium Businesses are not of size to afford dedicated resources to handle some of the aspects of the running the organization. This is where companies such as US Connect come into play. They (US Connect) provided IT Training and Services to such organizations. To be the most successful, one must learn to understand not only the technical issues, but also how they influence the business. While I understood Client / Server and Windows x86 platforms, I had begun to use increasing communications skills to find the right people who can clearly explain the business challenge and influence the decision makers to get to the gist of the business challenge, and in turn help the technical resources with tactical task completion.
