My experience ranges from preventive maintenance and troubleshooting, to spares and sustaining.  \n \nIn addition, I have been responsible for improvement processes that have helped my team be one of the top contributors across a 168 hour workforce. I have been responsible for containing nonstandard events in the production line which has saved the company time and money.  \n \nAs a trainer, I have trained several techs throughout my career which has allowed them to move within the company. I have been recognized for team leadership, ability to train, and instruct peers in manufacturing principles. \n \nI believe safety in the work place should be the number 1 priority. Not only is my own safety important but my team members safety is equally important. Losing one person on the team, due to a safety event, can have its disadvantages. We work to be able to do things we love; there is no sense in anyone getting hurt at work.  \n \nI have a high degree of judgment in resolving complex nonstandard problems and developing recommendations with little to no supervision. I like to be a leader as well as work in a team environment.  \n \nI enjoy meeting new people contact me if you would like to talk business or the outdoors.  \n \nSpecialties: material handling, basic knowledge in computers, problem solving, analysis, electrical, electromechanical, robotic (install, rebuild, calibration) optical sensors, motors, and vacuum systems.
