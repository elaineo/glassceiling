I consider myself to be a quick and eager learner, with the ability to internalize things that I learn. Once I grasp a concept, I rarely forget it. Working with my current team, I have learned many new things about power management in CPU, and post-silicon validation.  \n \nI graduated with a PhD in Computer Engineering from Iowa State University in spring 2011. My research focused on developing software and hardware level solutions for Power Aware, High Performance Computer Architectures. I have presented my research work at department seminars and reputed conferences. As a part of my extra-curricular activity, I was involved with Sankalp \u2013 a non-profit student volunteer organization at Iowa State. I also served as President of the organization during the year 2008-2009. \n \nGiven my technical skills, my passion for programming, and leadership skills, I would like to contribute to the technological paradigm that I believe will revolutionize the design of future processor architecture.
