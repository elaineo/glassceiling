Experience Undergrad Software Engineering Intern Intel Corporation June 2015  \u2013 Present (3 months) Folsom, California Utilizing the robust programming language of Python, and more specifically, the PyVisa library, I am automating several engineering tools(oscilloscope, network analyzer, external power supply). Through enabling the automation of these tools, I have saved many hours of, what would be, in-person debugging on computer memory technologies. \n \nI am also in charge of low power DDR3 and DDR4 memory test execution, as well as automating the validation and failure characterization of those devices. The automation is done via a Python program which parses the log file and organizes the data in a logical and easy to understand matter. The program then produces a very readable excel report. Web Developer Intern Field Squared January 2015  \u2013  April 2015  (4 months) Denver, CO At Field Squared I worked on the Web App aspect of their product, fixing bugs and defects, and also implementing requested features. \n \nWhile working here, I am contributed many client side AngularJS (JavaScript), HTML and CSS bug fixes in a fast paced development environment. Undergraduate Software Engineering Intern Intel Corporation May 2014  \u2013  December 2014  (8 months) Folsom, CA I worked in Test and Validation for PMO(Platform Memory Operations). PMO works with memory suppliers to help test, develop, and validate computer memory.  \n \nWhile at Intel: \n \n\u2022 Conducted functional and environmental tests on Dynamic Random-Access \nMemory (DRAM) chips, in Platform Memory Operations. \n\u2022 Automated validation processes by developing Python scripts, reducing task \ntime from 3 hours to 0 hours per chip. \n\u2022 Developed test flow code that helps test and debug DRAM chips, using C/C++. \n\u2022 Enabled remote control over environmental testing through a GPIB cable, and \nworked on a C program that allowed for scripting the temperature changes. Software Engineering Undergraduate Intern Rockwell Collins August 2011  \u2013  March 2014  (2 years 8 months) Cedar Rapids, Iowa Area At Rockwell Collins I started out in the high school internship program. It was a select program that gave Juniors and Seniors in highschoolers a chance to intern with several groups at Rockwell. After I graduated high school my position changed to a software engineering undergrad intern. Between the various groups i interned with, I learned a lot of technical and soft skills. \n \nSome achievements are: \n\u2022 Obtained a United States Government security clearance in order to \nautomate classified XML data retrieval and testing, using Java. \n\u2022 Helped to create a streamlined Linux development environment that nearly \neliminated the lengthy process of setting up a working environment for the \ntarget hardware. \n\u2022 Wrote a front-end in Java for the UCC (Unified Code Count) tool, which \nhelped to drastically reduce user interaction time amongst team members. \n\u2022 Wrote Python scripts that simulated communication between a Rockwell \nCollins product and an airport\u2019s ground control which helped release the \nproduct within its intended schedule. \n\u2022 Participant of a select high school internship program from 2011 to 2012.

Delhi May 2012  \u2013  July 2012  (3 months) IIT Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi The software developed was an SVM Solver which had options to choose among the various feature selection methods in order to solve problems with large scale data. An independent Localized Linear SVM solver was also implemented that used clustering as a pre-processing step.
