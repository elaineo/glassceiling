Experience FPGA and Hardware Engineer, Consultant DigitalSolutionsLab.com April 2015  \u2013 Present (5 months) My responsibilities include technical writing based on technology and on going hands-on projects. The technical articles are meant to be used as guides and how-tos for recent college graduates and out of work electrical/computer engineers, and gives them the tools and knowledge to either continue and/or renew their engineering training. Currently the website contains links to tools (the majority of them are free with the exception of hardware boards) needed to continue this training as well how to install and use them. All of the software tools are based on Linux (Red Hat) Operating Systems with emphasis on Open Source software. Article's topics include Altera Software (Quartus, Modelsim, QSys, etc), FPGA technology, Intel Architecture, Verilog and System Verilog, Embedded Systems, Board Design, Linux and the Yocto Project (Linux for Embedded devices). Articles based on SoC will be part of future writings and will be available as my expertise grows in that area. Owner - Fine Portrait Studio Fine Portrait Studio January 2003  \u2013  December 2014  (12 years) Elk Grove, CA As an entrepreneur, I ran a successful portrait studio in Elk Grove California. As a photographer, it enabled me to travel the state of California meeting people from all walks of life and backgrounds. This is a position/job where communication and customer service met on a daily basis. My images enabled me to win several awards locally at the Professional Photographers of the Sacramento Valley, including Portrait Photographer of the Year 2010. Because I have always believed that education is essential for success, I studied to become a Certified Professional Photographer (CPP) and became one from 2008 to 2014. Software used to run the studio included, Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, Apple OS X, Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Word and Excel. I also ran and setup my own website using HTML, Dreamweaver and Wordpress. The look of the website changed through the years as technology improved and it was easier to setup the Websites.

Assisted in creating technical solutions to complex chip set problems as brought by I/O Controller Hub customers. Meetings were setup with various engineers in which problem solving, decision making and excellent communications skills were used to communicate customer issues and solve them in a timely manner. Excellent written skills were needed in order to publish various internal and external documents to help ensure product technical information was clear and accurate. Organizational skills were needed in order to prioritize workload to be able to complete tasks in a timely manner. Excellent knowledge of Intel hardware and Intel architecture demonstrated by the creation and presentation and training of I/O Controller Hub Architectural geared towards technically instructing platform engineers on Southbridge product and technology changes. \nTop Key Accomplishments \nHub Interface Technology: Published Intel\u2019s first Hub Interface 1.5 Specification.
