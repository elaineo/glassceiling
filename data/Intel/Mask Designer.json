These designs are complex for timing and require precise routing, placement and planning. Quite often, the designs she is working on contain multiple power grids and exact route matching and shielding.  \nShe has consistently met her deadlines and often works with a remote engineer where meetings are held online and over the phone.  \nProjects include the following processes and often have multiple steppings and product designations for each. 1271 (22nm), 1273 (14nm), and 1275 (10nm) for both internal Intel products in the tablet and cell phone industry as well as Foundry. \nJamie has spent time going through procedures and documentation to update BKMs and to centralize data for quicker sharing of knowledge.

Senior Mask Designer Intel Corporation March 2011  \u2013  December 2012  (1 year 10 months) Chandler, AZ Jamie\u2019s primary responsibility in ATTD was test chip design. Jamie merged portions of multiple chips in order to test fab capability for production. Analog designs from base layers to bump level design were created and then built in the fab to validate design rules for product design team use. \nProjects that Jamie worked on were 1270 (22nm), 1271 (22nm), 1272 (14nm), and 1273 (14nm) processes \nJamie lead her own project while training her engineer on layout design in OR. As the only designer for this project, she was responsible for chip level planning and execution as well as all of the hierarchical design work. She taught the engineer fundamental layout techniques to enable minor edits and fewer iterations on his part. \nJamie worked closely with the Design Automation team to bring in automation macros to include route guide planning, fill tools, Opus, Safran, Gallery, and general planning and procedural strategies. Worked on test cases and documentation which she then presented to management for approval. Mask Designer Intel Corporation October 2001  \u2013  March 2011  (9 years 6 months) Hillsboro, Or Jamie attended an internal Mask Design training course which lasted 6 months and started in late 2000. During this time, Jamie was given a high level of understanding of hierarchy concepts, Unix usage, transistor design as well as circuit design and taught about route matching, timing requirements and all of the other fundamentals needed to be a successful layout designer. She led her group in the team final project and graduated at the top of her class. \nJamie worked on all Intel processor families for desktop computers from the Pentium 4 to the i-series. 1260 (130nm), 1262 (90nm), 1264 (65nm), 1266 (45nm), 1268 (32nm) and 1270 (22nm) \nJamie spent 10 years in this group and moved around quite a bit to expand her knowledge base. She worked on projects to include all types of layout (Analog, digital, Register File). She became an expert user for Genesys, and was often called on to pioneer new macros and guis for ease of use, bug removal, and efficiency. Jamie functioned as a section lead for her group, which involved monitoring progress on all layout in her section (100s of unit blocks), creating macros for automated testing and reporting, and helped keep her group problem free and working smoothly. She made final verification before handing any layout to the next level of design. \nJamie spent a percentage of her time creating and improving training documentation, helping with a weekly training class, and updating Gallery (gui used to create checklists and assist tracking for deadlines). She also joined the team that trained new mask designers and engineers in a classroom atmosphere. \nJamie was generally working on complex layout while doing these other tasks and often had multiple blocks in different projects going on at the same time. She has excellent organization skills and keeps highly detailed notes for reference and later training.

I do a lot of custom analog, mixed signal, matching, low power layout, and have worked on cells from the leaf level (library cells) to the IO Full Chip Family Level (top level). I have built entire standard cell libraries for both digital and analog circuitry with colored and non-colored metal patterns on processes as small as 14nm with FinFET devices. Experience in finalization of DRC and DFM coded rules (DRC Regressions). I have 5 years of Cadence VirtuosoXL and 5 years with Genesys experience. Hercules VUE, DRC, LVS, Density checks, along with some RV tools were required during my career as well. I have a strong work ethic and work well with others, but I am very self-sufficient and able to manage myself. Summary I have over 10 years of IC CMOS Mask Design Layout experience.
