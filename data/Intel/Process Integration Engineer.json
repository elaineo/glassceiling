I am responsible for process development and qualification of III-arsenide and phosphide processes for electronic and optoelectronic devices.  \n \nSpecifically, my responsibilities include technical review and validation, resource scheduling, process validation, troubleshooting process-related defect and electronic marginalities for yield improvement. \n \nI was owner of two solar cell projects on Veeco reactors, developing novel multi-band gap materials, capable of absorbing broad spectra light. \n \nIn order to better track performance of Veeco reactors, I created a database in JMP for all site Veeco reactors by writing macros in Excel to automatically summarize run data and enable correlation of ex-situ characterization data with all reactor parameters and equipment lifetime trackers. I trained all Veeco engineering and technical staff to effectively use JMP to establish correlations, track trends, and control chart data.

This team was responsible for the process health and improvement of all toolsets within the salicide-contact module. My individual responsibilities included ensuring tools and processes were targeted correctly, coordinating and driving process changes through all up- and down-stream impacted modules, and ensuring process impacts were correctly accounted for in yield and performance models.  \n \nOther responsibilities included process development and implementation, process and tool qualifications, troubleshooting integrated process impactors, defect reduction, process targeting, and process matching for the salicide and contact modules. Specifically, my duties included correlating tool level metrology signals to Etest/Yield data in order to model process health and predict yield, technical review and validation of all process changes.
