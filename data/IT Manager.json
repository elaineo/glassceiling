Product Manager, Brand Display Ads Google March 2012  \u2013  February 2014  (2 years) Mountain View 15 years ago, Google invented the \"click\" for online ads, and revolutionized the industry by bringing measurability to the art of advertising. While direct response dollars flow freely through the ecosystem, brand dollars are still tied up in traditional media like TV and print. The next revolution is to help brands transition to multiple screens where their users are spending their time; it will come with the invention of the \"click\" for branding! \n \nKey results: \n+ Led team of 65 without authority to develop $100M brand display business, with 50% penetration in top 200 brands \n+ Scaled rich media ads by streamlining purchase process down to 5 steps and reducing turn-around-time by 70% \n+ Pioneered 9 rich cross-screen interactive ad formats, capturing extra 20% queries from touch devices \n+ Spearheaded goal based buying strategy to optimize toward maximum user engagement with brand messages, resulting in 35% better engagement rates, at 25% lower cost-per-user-engagement \n+ Launched Engagement Developer Program to harvest 3rd party expertise in creative innovation, with 4 partners \n \nCheck out our brand advertising product here: http://www.google.com/think/products/engagement-ads.html Display Ads Chief of Staff Google August 2011  \u2013  December 2013  (2 years 5 months) Mountain View Display Ads started out with 2 simple goals: a) to bring advertisers' message to exactly the right customers wherever they are online and b) to keep the internet free by creating alternative monetization opportunities for millions of publishers. While achieving these goals, the Display Ads team at Google aims to transform online advertising from invasive and annoying to relevant and useful for all our users. \n \nI served as Chief of Staff to the VP, Google Display Ads with the following impact: \n+ Formulated annual strategy for multi-billion display ads business across team of 1000+ engineers & product managers.  \n+ Drafted annual and quarterly objectives and periodically reviewed key performance indicators to ensure delivery on big bets \n+ Led resource planning across display ads to prioritize projects to double down in, and identify those to be killed \n+ Managed display ads\u2019 launch pipeline and analyzed sustainable revenue and intangible impact, resulting in zero sensitive launches going through without thorough review \n+ Orchestrated weekly strategy reviews across engineering, product, sales and operations leaders, cycling through big bets to identify and remove any roadblocks, make market positioning decisions or craft competitive response  \n+ Evaluated 6 prospective deals with partners, resulting in 2 successful acquisitions; oversaw their integration plans Financial Analyst Google June 2009  \u2013  August 2011  (2 years 3 months) Mountain View Revenue forecasting is a key component of planning short, medium and long term roadmaps for the company, especially when there are several macro factors outside our control. The revenue forecasting team at Google is extremely analytical and rigorous in their prediction models and serve as a key stakeholder in strategic decisions across the company.  \n \nImpact: \n+ Built rigorous short and long term revenue forecasts for 6 (of 10) product lines, maintaining variance within +/-2% \n+ Identified key metrics to indicate health of product lines, and led weekly executive reviews of these metrics \n+ Analyzed & presented business drivers, regional variability, impact of sales compensation and economic trends \n+ Set quarterly quotas for 10000+ sales team, incentivizing them to meet stretch targets for strategic high-growth areas \n+ Drafted first P&L view of 6 product lines, empowering executives with their net impact to Google\u2019s bottom line Finance MBA Intern Google May 2008  \u2013  August 2008  (4 months) Mountain View, California Internships at Google are an opportunity to explore its diverse culture: the healthy disregard for the impossible, asking for forgiveness rather than permission, thinking big, no, bigger. And while having fun, this is a great opportunity for students to discover if they'd like to come back full-time. \n \nAs a Financial Analyst MBA intern: \n+ Analyzed (decaying) impact of product launches on Google's revenue streams; build robust system to capture impact of launches into revenue forecasts, improving forecast time by 83% and saving 1.5 hours per cycle \n+ Led team of 3 engineers to develop an internal system to track financial and strategic impacts of product launches \n+ Found a full time role at the company :) Software Engineer Infosys Technologies Ltd June 2006  \u2013  July 2007  (1 year 2 months) Bangalore, India Infosys is an Indian technology consulting firm focused on building enterprise solutions. Maintaining strong relationships with clients is Infosys's mantra: happy clients = repeat business. My team serviced Reed Elsevier's educational publishing division. Our client was satisfied with our work: we won a repeat $2.5M at the end of our project! \n \nBesides web development, I designed and developed a defect tracking system to reduce turnaround time for most common defects in amateur code. I also led training sessions for new hires, thus bridging the steep ramp up from college to productive engineers.
