It involves building machine learning and operations research models to solve key issues facing Intel and the role has enabled me to build excellent project management skills. Here\u2019s a summary of few projects: \n \n\u2022\tCollaborating with analytics lead to build inventory control towers\u2013 a system that provides status of finished goods at various stages of the supply chain, compares statuses with planned inventory and builds 5 successive random forests using R randomForest package to highlight stages where finished goods are less than planned inventory.  \no\tReturn on Investment (ROI): The project provides a great tool to recognize problem areas and it will be used by management and factory managers on a daily basis. \n \n\u2022\tManaged a project that involved building a supply chain network to reduce Carbon Dioxide footprint.
