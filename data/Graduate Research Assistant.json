The ultimate goal of the nerve conduit that we were attempting to develop was to hasten the regeneration of peripheral nerves by providing a scaffold upon which peripheral nerves could grow, and to hasten the growth process through electrical stimulation. I was specifically assigned the task of reading primary literature to investigate prior research regarding discoveries about the body\u2019s response to nerve damage. I learned many new techniques while conducting my UROP. The specific laboratory techniques that I learned were electrospinning, initiating, maintaining, and terminating cell lines, preparing samples for Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR), running a PCR, high performance liquid chromatography, and scanning electron microscopy.
