Lead Business Systems Analyst /Process Lead Intel Corporation December 2014  \u2013  July 2015  (8 months) Hillsboro, OR As the result of a reorg, David joined the program team responsible for delivering salesforce.com CRM to Intel's Sales and Marketing Organization. David's primary focus is on consumer and channel support (also known as post-sales support), ensuring an effective and efficient transition from the existing on-premise SAP-based CRM solution to salesforce.com's cloud-based service cloud solution. As the lead business analyst, David is responsible for ensuring that all functional areas are working together seamlessly to provide a cohesive design that delivers all necessary business functionality. As the process lead, David is responsible for helping steer his consumer and channel support business partners in the Sales and Marketing Organization towards industry-best-practice processes which align as much as possible with out-of-the-box salesforce.com capabilities. Business Systems Analyst/Scrummaster Intel Corporation January 2014  \u2013  November 2014  (11 months) Beaverton, OR David was the IT representative for post-sales support in the Cloud CRM RFP process. He partnered with representatives from pre-sales support and business partners to create a detailed list of requirements and scoring criteria. David participated in multiple rounds of scoring of vendor responses and conducted deep dive reviews. When the team ultimately selected salesforce.com to transform Intel\u2019s CRM processes and tools, his contributions provided confidence that the best decision was made. \n \nDavid worked with The Wharton School to facilitate a Field Application Project, writing and then analyzing the results of a survey sent to 3000 pre-sales stakeholders across Intel. That analysis helped define the next few years\u2019 focus for pre-sales support tools. \n \nWhile providing sabbatical coverage for a colleague, David joined an inflight project to enable consumer webticketing and used his attention to detail to identify numerous technical gaps with the planned deployment. David worked across IT groups to develop a solution to transition from the legacy email webform tool to webticketing without customer impact, including working with worldwide product support engineers to identify and resolve a multitude of data quality issues. David\u2019s efforts directly contributed to the successful deployment of the solution and resulted in his being awarded a GRA. \n \nAlso as part of the sabbatical coverage, David joined a team trying to deploy an eGain-based knowledge management solution. David served as an embedded scrum coach, which quickly morphed into a full time ScrumMaster role. He brought direction to the team by developing a single prioritized list of needs to which the team could execute. David\u2019s get well plan included working extensively with production support to enable effective L2 support, defining a methodical approach for responding to the tool\u2019s numerous production outages, and prioritizing the paydown of significant technical debt. Product Manager (Scrum Product Owner) Intel Media January 2013  \u2013  December 2013  (1 year) Santa Clara, California A one year rotation to Intel Media. \n \nDavid leveraged his extensive customer support business process and tools knowledge to deliver detailed business requirements to Intel Media\u2019s AudienceCare team for their implementation of Salesforce.com, establishing himself as a knowledge expert for business colleagues as well as internal and outsourced technical teams. David also facilitated the Intel Media team\u2019s own elucidation of requirements. David\u2019s work supported the release of a ~3000 user beta test of Intel Media\u2019s prototype. \n \nDavid capitalized on his position as a neutral, trusted advisor to Intel Media to influence the engineering team to adopt Intel\u2019s proven BKM-based design, integrating with Intel\u2019s systems of record. David did this by navigating the organizational dynamics, identifying pockets of entrenched resistance, and then using data and reason to demonstrate how his proposal best met the business and technical needs of the organization. In David's role as the Scrum Product Owner for the logistics team, David provided structure and created the action plan the team used to move from relative chaos to a functional, integrated, and enterprise-scale solution for forward and reverse direct-to-consumer logistics. Business Systems Analyst Intel Corporation May 2009  \u2013  April 2013  (4 years) Hillsboro, Oregon David was an analyst on the team responsible for replacing Intel's PeopleSoft CRM-based solution with an SAP CRM-based solution for Intel's customer-facing call centers worldwide; once completed, the team then replaced Intel's custom-built OEM/ODM/ISV customer support tool with an SAP CRM-based solution. David had multiple responsibilities, including data migration, product master data, web portal, UI, and a major focus on email capabilities, both agent-facing and automated notifications. \n \nLeveraging his legacy technical & business process knowledge & expertise, David lead the email capability efforts. By engaging with worldwide stakeholders, documenting requirements and use cases, David ensured EIM provided the necessary capabilities to enable Intel\u2019s contact centers to provide support to Intel\u2019s customers via email. David championed an innovative testing methodology to test production volumes of emails in a preproduction environment. As a result, no email outages were recorded due to EIM deficiencies and ~100 email addresses were eliminated from production, reducing administrative costs and environment complexity, setting the stage for success in future efforts of additional simplification. David provided critical troubleshooting skills and knowledge to the production support teams supporting email infrastructure during and after production outages within related systems. \n \nDavid designed a solution using existing internal tools to eliminate the use of a third party email auto-response system, saving Intel $162k annually, vastly improving IT's responsiveness to new configuration requirements, and eliminating the 12+ multi-user outages annually which were associated with the 3rd party solution. \n \nIn 2010, David received an Intel IT Excellence Award for his work on the EIM project. In 2011, David received 29 different recognitions/awards from 21 different individuals, all for excellence in results delivery or for going above and beyond what was expected. Technical Program Manager / Sr. Technical Marketing Engineer Intel Corporation December 2005  \u2013  May 2009  (3 years 6 months) Hillsboro, Oregon David was responsible for day to day operations of his loaner programs, including interfacing with the business owners, overseeing the preparation and shipment of orders, coordinating the return of due and overdue hardware, managing the pool inventory, preparing program indicators, and various one-off projects, as indicated below. \n \nIn his first year, David was responsible for retrieving or otherwise dispositioning hundreds of overdue hardware orders. He conducted an exhaustive audit of all existing programs and diligently pursued each order to conclusion. David simultaneously established new processes to maintain inventory integrity and accuracy in shipping and receiving. \n \nDavid oversaw the consolidation of three disparate labs in to a single collocated lab. The successful merging of 15+ loaner programs, 5 program managers and TMEs, and 7+ contingent workers took painstaking planning and tireless attention to detail. \n \nDavid next focused on team-wide process definition and documentation, driving improvements that increased efficiency and decreased quality escapes. David interfaced with other groups around Intel (e.g., shipping and receiving, haz-mat, space planners, excess hardware dispositioning, Intel security, etc.) to improve inter-team communication and coordination. \n \nDavid provided onsite event support at trade shows, sales and marketing events, forums, college recruiting events, etc., worldwide. Event support included event planning, on-site hardware setup, configuration and support, and tear down, as well as \"booth duty\" when required. Successful event support required strong technical skills, adaptability and flexibility, and a strong customer orientation. David was requested by name by numerous key stakeholders due to the excellent onsite support he consistently provided. \n \nDavid directly supervised 1 contingent worker, including providing process and technical training, and assisted with technical screening of most of the lab workers. Reporting Technical Program Manager Intel Corporation May 2005  \u2013  December 2005  (8 months) Hillsboro, Oregon David was responsible for all aspects of the post-sales customer support reporting platform, including EPM and Microstrategy tools. David was primarily responsible for the integrity of the reporting platform and for driving all KTBR and KTBE work in the reporting platform. David took over the reporting tool program management immediately after the first release deployed at the end of May. The initial deployment had numerous bugs and failed to provide a number of key capabilities promised to stakeholders. David oversaw the small team of off-shore developers who worked on stabilizing and correcting the reporting platforms. Besides standard program management, David also provided critical input in to design, troubleshooting, QA, and business analysis for reporting tools. \n \nSurveys were conducted at the start and end of David's efforts which showed across the board improvements in user satisfaction (20.8% increase in satisfaction score), ease of use (22% decrease in unsatisfied), performance & reliability (49% increase in good/very good), and communication (17% increase in Very Satisfied). David left the data within the reporting system reliable and accurate and, perhaps most importantly, left our users with confidence in the data and the tool.
