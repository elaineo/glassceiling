", "Summary I am broadly interested in the design, modeling, and performance analysis of wireless architectures and technologies that enable future high rate applications. Recently, we proposed models to design and analyze (r)evolutionary architectures like self-backhauled millimeter wave wireless cellular networks and decoupled uplink/downlink access in HetNets. In past, I studied techniques and algorithms to leverage the true capacity potential of heterogeneous wireless networks (LTE, GSM, WiFi, macrocells, smallcells) by smartly steering traffic across them.
