", "Summary - Active DOC Security Clearance \n \nMy goal is to continue to expand my knowledge in the computer security field. I've worked in law enforcement for about 5 years before returning back to school to obtain my degree in computer security which I received May 2013. This field is of interest to me because it will allow me to fight crime on a different level than I have previously. I have had a close personal relationship with the community. Previous jobs required me to work with and locate violent offenders. Most of my experience is face to face, and while I have found that to be rewarding in its own right, crime has taken on a whole new turn. I have been working in the area of Intrusion Detection for the last 2 years. While I enjoy my work, I would like to progress from this area and begin working on the forensic aspect. I am intrigued and excited by the idea of searching through a system or network and figuring out the best way to detect, quarantine and stop a threat from continuing to spread. I have seen multiple infections spread through a network and have assisted in tracking and collecting data on these infections. My goal is to become a vital part of removing these infections and to assist in setting up networks to deter them.
