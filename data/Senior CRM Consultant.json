KPMG was my first \"border crossing\" from a staff role as a bank Financial Officer to a line role generating revenue in the Corporate Performance Management (CPM) space. However, providing advice to bankers without seeing improvement in organizational behavior left me unsatisfied. I left the banking industry and moved to Dallas to develop and implement enterprise financial software on IBM systems - a second \"border crossing\" of location and personal transformation.  \n \nThe change occurred when I learned my Myers-Briggs Work Type Indicator (MBTI\u00ae) during consulting training at The IBM Executive Institute (ENTP: Inventive) and developed a three year career plan and life mission statement. Strategic solution sales is my \"sweet spot\" because the field is always fresh and leverages my personality, communication gifts and global CPM project management success. Several sales awards and club trips followed, but relationships with CxOs and executives in healthcare, retail, eCom and energy have been most gratifying. Trusted adviser has been the best \"border crossing.\"  \n \nHighlights were: \n \n1)\tGrew software businesses in the mobility, ITSM and CRM space with amazing teams at AT&T, HP and IBM. One of them is a $200 million business today. The other was SaaS sold to DELL,  \n2)\tCreated a church service in 2000 that continues to improve people and  \n3)\tTrained Philippine contact center ISPs and CSRs to sell solutions and serve customers.  \n \nWhen not helping customers add value to their businesses with big data analytics, you can find me with my family, in church, serving the community, at Texas A&M University, running on nature paths or on the tennis courts with my USTA team.
