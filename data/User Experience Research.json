'Ad hoc professionals' negotiate a changing landscape of work suppliers to sell their services and make a living outside of traditional employment relationships. This type of career poses a challenge to tech business models that differentiate between enterprise and consumer sales. There is a third category emerging between the two thanks to consumer-led enterprise innovation. My aim is to help workers empower themselves and flourish in this context. \n \nAs an Australian-born researcher, I have an international profile in gender and cultural studies, work and organization studies and affect theory. My forthcoming book, Counterproductive, is a history of time management self-help in the workplace. It shows how productivity tools came to prominence as employment shifts contributed to a decline in collective opportunities for structured time and ritual. This book builds on my earlier analyses of contemporary work life which include Work\u2019s Intimacy (Polity 2011), The Affect Theory Reader (co-edited with Gregory J.
