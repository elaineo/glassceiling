", "Summary From my professional and private life I take most pleasure in integration design, integration implementation and troubleshooting. Using a fair amount of development/scripting skills to do the job only makes it all the more interesting. \n \nDuring my time with IBM I was a part of the \"Technical Resources\" network for technical employees with strong Leadership skills. All though I do not want to (and do not like) the formal part of the management role, I am known for my strong skills as a team leader.  \n \nSo what have I done to call myself an Architect specializing in integration. \n \nI led the team that succeeded in enabling high availability integration between the IBM Edge Server and Lotus Domino.Doc for one of our bigger clients. This work was done despite being told by the Lotus Lab that it was not possible due to architecture limitations \n \nI drove the establishment of a dedicated distributed self led development team 15 colleges split between Denmark and Poland. The team is still self led and I have moved on to fill a different role. \n \nI lead the work on a proof of concept on business process monitoring.

The work encompassed solving some of IBM's top 100 customer\u2019s biggest headaches which almost always involved their most mission critical technology. More then deep technology know how was needed to include a 360 set of skills - strong customer interaction capabilities, project management and estimating skills and identifying human factors in IT delivery that would improve IT and resulting business performance. Key customers included JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Regions Bank, Nationwide Insurance, Kroger, Cox Communications and others. \n \nRob was responsible for the entry point at creating service deals in terms of achievable Statements of Works (SOW) including costing details. He worked closely with many regional (e.g. Ohio/Pennsylvania,/Michigan) IBM Practice Managers across the US. Also Rob was a key initiator of many multimillion dollar deals as a result of having deep product knowledge and his own significant customer success experiences. Often he pulled in past customers to corroborate these successes. This triggered customer epiphanies that resulted in reduction of critical pain points while achieving cost savings. For example, a $800,000 software sale in less than two weeks on software that helped identify critical performance bottlenecks within mission critical applications.

James plans, sets and articulates the overall technical strategy for IBM\u2019s interaction with the clients for which he is responsible and also provides architectural and account leadership to the extended IBM team. As a trusted adviser, James works as a technical consultant to his clients architecting and delivering complex cross-platform solutions that solve both business and technical problems. James regularly uses his experience and informed judgement to perform challenging assessments, leading in setting technical direction, applying consulting techniques and established methods to realise the objectives he is set. His role is heavily oriented towards building and maintaining long term strategy and value, demonstrating strong interpersonal skills to consistently make this happen. Due to the scope and complexity of the work this requires efficient multi-tasking and attention to detail at all times. From a commercial point of view, James regularly develops value propositions, provides input to business cases, and also insight for costing and deal negotiation. \n \n\u2022\tTechnology Strategy & Architecture \n\u2022\tEnterprise Architecture (TOGAF) \n\u2022\tMethod Development & Adoption \n\u2022\tArchitectural Roadmap Development \n\u2022\tSmarter Commerce \n\u2022\tEmerging Technologies Solution Architect / Lead Architect, IBM Software Group. IBM Corporation (US) May 2008  \u2013  July 2010  (2 years 3 months) James moved to the IBM Corporation in the United States in 2008 and held the positions of Solution and Lead Architect with the IBM Software Group. As a Solution Architect he was accountable for scoping and architecting many large-scale enterprise based solutions in the South Central, Pacific Northwest and Pacific Southwest regions of the United States. This included the translation of business requirements into robust design specifications, the development of detailed project plans and cost estimates (work breakdown structure, resource identification, effort, timeframe, profit and loss), and the creation of detailed proposals and Statements of Work (SOWs) while ensuring the technical and business integrity of such propositions. A considerable amount of James\u2019 time was spent articulating the business value of the solutions he proposed (BVA/ROI/TCO). As a Lead Architect, James was responsible for managing the complete architectural design and development process, from requirements management, through to systems, application and/or process design realization. In most cases, James led by example and personally took charge in developing many of the architectural deliverables himself. Project Lead responsibilities included providing leadership and direction to IBM delivery teams through the complete Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), driving service quality and making improvements to the delivery processes where needed, and ensuring the achievement of business goals. On the occasions that certain team members fell short of the mark, James intervened and picked up the pieces rectifying any shortcomings. \n \n\u2022\tArchitectural & Technical Leadership \n\u2022\tSolution Design and Implementation \n\u2022\tInfrastructure Architecture Design \n\u2022\tProject & Resource Management \n\u2022\tClient Value Proposition Senior Consulting IT Architect, IBM GMU Asia Pacific. IBM Singapore Pte. Ltd. January 2006  \u2013  April 2008  (2 years 4 months) Singapore After a year of moving to the IBM China Development Lab (CDL), James managed to develop his role to cover the whole of Asia Pacific and in doing so managed to increase his contribution to the region. As a Regional Software Technical Leader, James was often called upon by the most highly visible, high worth and high risk of IBM accounts in Asia Pacific. Indeed, during his time in this role James was personally asked by the IBM AP Executive Leadership team to take over the architectural leadership at one of the region\u2019s largest, and most troubled, software projects in the telecommunications industry. The project was unique in that it was facing a serious risk of failure, as well as at risk of being cancelled, when James was asked to intervene and take over as the IBM Principal Lead Architect. James was responsible for not only re-architecting the entire solution but also getting the project back on track and leading the implementation effort. As such, this involved dividing his time between the architectural aspects of the solution (BPM, SOA, & SDP solution design) and fire fighting the more immediate (technical implementation) issues. At the height of the implementation effort the core project team totalled nearly thirty five with additional resources brought in for limited periods of time to provide specialist skills and expertise. Critical to the success of the project was James\u2019 ability to be immediately productive and to use his deep architectural knowledge and technical leadership experience gained from his time with the IBM China Development Lab (CDL) and the IBM UK Hursley Development Lab. \n \n\u2022\tArchitectural & Technical Leadership \n\u2022\tApplication Architecture Design \n\u2022\tBusiness Process Management Design \n\u2022\tIntegration Architecture Design \n\u2022\tInfrastructure Architecture Design \n\u2022\tTelecom OSS/BSS & TMF NGOSS \n\u2022\tKenan FX & Siemens IN \n\u2022\teCommerce & CRM \n\u2022\tIBM SPDE & Multi-Channel Delivery \n\u2022\tEnd-to-End SDLC Management Senior IT Architect, IBM China Development Lab (CDL) IBM China / Hong Kong Ltd.

His areas of expertise included providing architectural leadership and deep technical consultancy to both Clients and IBM teams alike. Focusing predominantly on the Communications Service Provider (Telecom) and Financial Services Sector, James was accountable for leading a number of large-scale, full-life cycle, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) projects. This included mentoring IBM and Client IT Architects on the principles of SOA adoption and implementation, leading technical design sessions, advising on IBM recommended best practices, providing product insight and knowledge, whilst all the time acting as the lead IBM technology champion and advocate. During his time in this role, James was also responsible for spearheading several significant client based initiatives, including the Performance and Benchmarking programme at UBS Wealth Management Asia Pacific and an Electronic Commerce & Portal initiative at Huawei Technology Co., (Shenzhen). \n \n\u2022\tArchitectural & Technical Leadership \n\u2022\tService Oriented Architecture (SOA) \n\u2022\tApplication Design & Delivery \n\u2022\tBusiness Process Management (BPM) \n\u2022\tMessage Oriented Middleware (MOM) \n\u2022\tGSMethod, TeAMethod, RUP, SoMA \n\u2022\tSWIFT, X12, EDIFACT, RosettaNet Senior IT Architect, IBM Hursley Development Labs.

As a Regional Software Technical Leader, James was often called upon by the most highly visible, high worth and high risk of IBM accounts in Asia Pacific. Indeed, during his time in this role James was personally asked by the IBM AP Executive Leadership team to take over the architectural leadership at one of the region\u2019s largest, and most troubled, software projects in the telecommunications industry. The project was unique in that it was facing a serious risk of failure, as well as at risk of being cancelled, when James was asked to intervene and take over as the IBM Principal Lead Architect. James was responsible for not only re-architecting the entire solution but also getting the project back on track and leading the implementation effort. As such, this involved dividing his time between the architectural aspects of the solution (BPM, SOA, & SDP solution design) and fire fighting the more immediate (technical implementation) issues. At the height of the implementation effort the core project team totalled nearly thirty five with additional resources brought in for limited periods of time to provide specialist skills and expertise.
