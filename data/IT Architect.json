Within one month I was actively working large opportunities, and within six months had several major wins under my belt. My role primarily consists of working with clients to understand their business and technology needs, the current state of their platform, and leveraging my Openstack and general IT expertise to design a solution that meets their needs. My broad experience within the IT space allows me to be extremely effective in the wide variety of tasks that this role requires, and allows me to convey a confidence in both the quality of our solutions, and our customer-centric design approach. Product Manager--Private Cloud Storage Rackspace, the Open Cloud Company March 2013  \u2013  October 2013  (8 months) San Antonio, Texas Area Shortly after accepting my prior position as Private Cloud Architect, I was asked by our product organization to fill a need for a Product Manager with both intimate knowledge of our private cloud offerings, and a solid understanding of Product. I worked on enhancing our private cloud portfolio by developing compelling storage offerings leveraging our existing capabilities, and identifying and prioritizing future product opportunities. I also advised product and segment leadership on current trends, and helped turn high-level concepts into actionable strategies by providing the appropriate context and technical detail. OpenStack Private Cloud Engineer/Architect Rackspace Hosting February 2012  \u2013  March 2013  (1 year 2 months) San Antonio, Texas Area Shortly after returning to the company, I was tasked with the creation of a private cloud support team. I was one of the founding members of the team, which became the fastest growing segment of the company. In addition to supporting our private cloud customers, I provided technical leadership for the team, and created processes and procedures to allow for a scalable and highly effective support organization. I provided monitoring specifications, and assisted in workflow automation and configuration management for our customer environments. Later, I was tasked with becoming our SME for Openstack Object Storage (Swift), and developed the architectures on which our private cloud storage offering is based. I also provided support to sales, and guidance to our support and product leadership. This resulted in my transition to a Private Cloud Architect role. Senior Virtualization Architect Rackspace Hosting November 2011  \u2013  February 2012  (4 months) San Antonio, Texas Area I took a major VM Replication project that had gone \"off the rails\" and identified technical and operational roadblocks that were preventing the project from advancing. I coordinated with the relevant vendor and with internal Rackspace groups, and eliminated the obstacles preventing a successful launch. This involved working with the vendor's software engineers to rearchitect the product to function within the constraints of our environment. Lead Linux Engineer Clear Channel April 2010  \u2013  November 2011  (1 year 8 months) I manage the platform on which all Clear Channel Radio station sites, iheartradio.com, and a variety of other content is hosted. I took a very unstable platform (multiple weekly outages) and tuned and rearchitected it to a stable state (no infrastructure outages so far this year). I implemented a backup strategy for critical data. I designed a monitoring solution, and coordinated the deployment and implementation with our monitoring group, including escalation processes, runbooks, and runbook automation. This solution was originally targeted only for the platforms for which I was responsible, but has now been adapted to monitor critical processes across the company. I also implemented and/or developed a variety of systems for process automation, including automated deployment, configuration management, and web-based \"self-service\" for user and site management. I was instrumental in the creation of a division-wide Change Management process, which allowed us to gain more insight into ongoing workflows, and limit the impact of potentially disruptive changes. Linux Systems Administrator Rackspace Hosting September 2009  \u2013  April 2010  (8 months) I returned to support to champion one of our Linux teams, who were without any L3 techs at the time. I acted as an escalation point and mentor for the team, and created a weekly training program \"Unstoppable Linux Fundamentals\" in which I both authored and delivered courses on a variety of topics, including Apache configuration and performance tuning, regular expressions, and others. I also wrote a variety of scripts to enhance our capabilities, including runbook-automation scripts to do reporting on full hard drives and compromised servers, a sar parser (Parsar), and a script to generate reports on weak passwords on Plesk servers.
