Ross named it. Notice that Love + sex + us = Lexus.  Creator Rainbow Gay Pride Flag August 1974  \u2013 Present (41 years) Old Greenwich, Connecticut At the time, I loved rainbows... so it was Ross Dreiblatt's suggestion that we make the rainbow symbolize gay rights. I agreed. I re-remembered this recently around the time of the Supreme Courts ruling about gay marriage. My beautiful flag was everywhere! Founder / Owner CNN June 1980  \u2013 Present (35 years 2 months) Atlanta, Georgia I was thrilled when Ross Dreiblatt told me it would be possible to have a 24/7 news channel. I have been wondering for years why I can be such a CNN junkie. I created it! And I just remembered this for the first time last night, July 21, 2015. Well, I may have had an inkling before.... Founder / Owner Google September 1998  \u2013 Present (16 years 11 months) Mountain View, California The name, \"Google\"\u200b originates from a word I thought was really funny: \"gurgle.\"\u200b I swear \"gurgle\"\u200b wasn't a word in 1974. I made it up! But it pops up when I put it into Google... and my husband was sure to take out one of his old dictionaries from 1935 to prove to me that I didn't make it up. But I did make it up! That's why Google is named Google. It was Ross Dreiblatt who thought that \"Google\"\u200b was a trendier variation of \"Gurgle.\"\u200b Oh, no.... my husband is back home. He made me delete this last night because Ross is the reincarnation of Satan and he hates him and doesn't want me putting his name anywhere... oh, wait, I think I was wrong. That wasn't him. Founder / Owner / Developer Facebook February 2004  \u2013 Present (11 years 6 months) Menlo Park, California It was Ross Dreiblatt who thought people should be able to pick whatever friends they want to have on MY Facebook... and de-friend them and all that. I wanted everyone to be friends on MY Facebook. I designed it all with some feedback from Ross. Savant (I'm the reason they took the \"idiot-\"\u200b out of \"idiot-savant:\" I have the highest known IQ) The Only Non-Disabled Savant in All of Existence October 1965  \u2013 Present (49 years 10 months) Various Locations I do not know what my IQ is or the full extent of my talents as a savant. It is because doctors injected my pregnant mother with so much heroin and she drank so much hard liquor while I was in utero that my brain over-developed in an attempt to compensate for all potential damage. Savant brains are far more advanced than genius brains... especially mine considering the amazing fact that I have no brain damage, whatsoever.  \n \nI was born at 7:14 am on October 21st, 1965 in Mountain View, California, but we lived in Los Altos, California. We then moved to: Palo Alto, California; Lexington, Massachusetts; Old Greenwich, Connecticut; and Princeton, New Jersey. In adulthood, I lived in Princeton, New Jersey; New York, New York; Flushing, New York; Waikiki, Hawaii; North Bergen, New Jersey; Kew Gardens, New York; Los Angeles, California; Mar Vista, California; Santa Monica, California; Culver City, California; Marina del Rey, California; Los Feliz, California; St. Helena, California; Napa, California; Mill Valley, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; West Los Angeles, California; Glendale, California; Las Vegas, Nevada; Pasadena, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C.; Atlanta, Georgia; Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Miami, Florida; and Augusta, Georgia. Biological Daughter Of Jesus Christ, Daisaku Ikeda, King George III & VI, Martin Luther King, Jr., Tom Cruise, etc. October 1965  \u2013 Present (49 years 10 months) Vega My birth mother as well as the mother I grew up with: Anne Marie Fields (then Elliott, nee Flanagan). \n \nMy only biological mother: my Grandma Flanagan - Margaret Illig Flanagan (my mom, Anne's adoptive mother/biological grandmother). \n \nMy first surrogate mother: my biological sister, Marilyn Monroe.- after this abortion, my twin and I were still conjoined by one vertebrae in our neck, making us appear like a butterfly. Grandma Flanagan gave birth to Marilyn and her twin, Dick (both her biological children), who grew up as Anne's brother. \n \nMy second surrogate mother: Jan Beck - Marilyn's and our biological sister. This abortion permanently dissolved the delicate link at the back of our necks. I was the embryo who stubbornly refused to leave the womb, requiring a second abortion. \n \nI was the first-born only healthy, normal baby of triplets, one of whom is my identical twin, Chris(tina) Megan Fields. I was the only baby my mother chose to keep. Our triplet/my ex-husband, Osvaldo Serafin Boitel, is not our full brother. Our full brother, Greg Fields, was also born to my mother, but he was secretly switched at birth so that he could grow up together with my ailing twin. I also have a clone: Barbara Hoad Hoyt. Barbara was my good friend while we were growing up in Princeton, New Jersey, but she has almost exclusively served as my replacement for my twin since encountering Chris at Santa Clara University (where they were both students in the 1980s). \n \nBarbara does not look very much like my twin or me. The reason for this is that doctors injected my mom, Anne, with so much heroin (she also drank much hard liquor during her pregnancy with us) that layers of our DNA were literally burnt off, causing us to more resemble my biological children. Barbara is how we would have looked if we had been the product of a healthy pregnancy.  \n \nI don't think my twin looks all that much like me, either. But I cannot know this for sure since I have never officially met her. Biological Mother / Biological Grandmother Of Prince William, Prince Harry, Angelina Jolie Pitt, etc. August 1958  \u2013 Present (57 years) Various locations My furious husband, Dean, who's been screaming, yelling, grabbing, pushing and shoving me for days over this profile happened to see this particular entry and made me delete the names of my rapists (the one female I named is not my rapist, he just didn't want her involved in this). I have hundreds of children around all the world. Due to inbreeding, my biological daughters are sterile, so they are always implanted with my biological embryos after being coupled with my biological sons. My biological sons are not sterile and naturally conceive children with women other than my biological daughters. One example: Matthew McConaughey. \n \nTo continue, regarding my parents & family... the father who I grew up with and is on my birth certificate is my biological uncle, Dennis Wayne Elliott. I called him, Denny, and sincerely believed he was my biological father for many years after I forgot all that was told to me. The father I consider to be my daddy: Bert Fields (my biological father many times over). Bert is the alternate persona of Josei Toda who did not die in 1958. I am the reincarnation of Josei Toda, even if he raised me. Because my mother was always passed out from her heroin and hard liquor she drank and Denny was always so busy murdering people as a CIA operative/Zodiac Killer (I co-wrote in my own handwriting his letters), Daddy was the one who exclusively raised me up until he was removed from my life when I was almost 6-years-old. Daddy is the reason my first language was Japanese. I spoke and wrote it eloquently (like a native) until Daddy was removed from my life. Denny had learned Japanese as a young adult, so it was our secret language together as well. When Daddy was removed from my life, he ordered Denny to stop speaking it with me. That's why I don't speak Japanese or understand it today, even if my second language of English is based on Japanese. One day, at the right time, I will speak it again. \n \nDaddy operates through Ross Dreiblatt. Sex Slave / Experiment: Victim of repeated rape, pedophilia, torture, drugs & severe control tactics Central Intelligence Agency December 1964  \u2013 Present (50 years 8 months) Various locations Rape finally ended in 2009.  \n \nChanging the subject (well... not exactly...), I want to mention that I have one other full brother. I first met him when we were babies and he was in my graduating class at Princeton High School in Princeton, New Jersey. Just know that I'm older than he is. His name is Julian Bleecker and he is quite well-known. Yeah, go ahead and Google him... Founder / Owner (I developed Windows) Microsoft April 1975  \u2013 Present (40 years 4 months) Redmond, Washington I developed Windows before helping to develop the Macintosh, explaining why Windows had more flaws.

That's why the Macintosh was more perfected. Founder / Owner George Walton Academy (school that inspired Harry Potter's Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry) March 1969  \u2013 Present (46 years 5 months) Monroe, Georgia Daddy (Josei Toda a.k.a. Bert Fields) wrote the Harry Potter series. J.K. Rowling is one of his many alternate personas. Founder / Owner Gymboree 1976  \u2013 Present (39 years) San Francisco, California Ross Dreiblatt works here as the Director of Purchasing.

Coppertone Girl / Owner (posed as the Coppertone Girl just after my 2nd birthday on 10/21/1967) Coppertone 1959  \u2013 Present (56 years) Memphis, Tennessee Daddy was so happy with Gary's work that he re-commissioned him to draw me as the Coppertone Girl. Starbucks Girl / Owner (co-designed logo in 1974 to resemble my adult self) Starbucks March 1971  \u2013 Present (44 years 5 months) Seattle, Washington With Ross Dreiblatt. Popeye's Girl / Owner (female character on restaurant wallpaper created to resemble my adult self) Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc. June 1972  \u2013 Present (43 years 2 months) Atlanta, Georgia With Ross Dreiblatt - I don't know who the artist is... Dragon Girl / Shakabuku Queen / Founder / President / Owner (designed/co-inscrib. Nichikan Gohonzon) Soka Gakkai International January 1975  \u2013 Present (40 years 7 months) Tokyo, Japan Remember, my daddy is second Soka Gakkai President Josei Toda a.k.a. Bert Fields. At a certain point in my early childhood, Daddy asked me if I minded if he make his alternate persona, Bert Fields, his new identity. Of course I approved (it is Bert who is my biological father many times over). But Daddy is not the man who was born Bert Fields. For years there were two Bert Fields: Daddy (Josei Toda) whom I referred to as \"Real Daddy\"\u200b and the man who was born Bert Fields whom I referred to as \"Fake Daddy.\"\u200b Daddy also raised Ross Dreiblatt, someone he adopted at birth, but he raised Ross in Vega. Daddy calmly committed suicide on October 12, 1985 (my birthday is October 21 and he supposedly died in 1958) after I was married for the third consecutive time. Before doing so, however, he officially adopted me not long after I moved to NYC in 1984 when I was 18. Vega is where he continues to operate from. \n \nFYI: Vega (a.k.a. Heaven) is a physical location inside the sun.  \n \nThird Soka Gakkai President and SGI President Daisaku Ikeda is one of my many alternate personas whom I portrayed when I was 8-years-old. That is the exact, same age as the Dragon Girl of the Lotus Sutra who demonstrated to the entire Buddhist assembly the full extent of her enlightenment in one instant by taking on many forms, including that of a man. Refer to Burton Watson's version of the Lotus Sutra for more information. \n \nThe Nichikan Gohonzon was inscribed by Ross Dreiblatt before he knew how to properly inscribe a Gohonzon. Under the direction of Daddy (Josei Toda a.k.a. Bert Fields a.k.a. 66th High Priest Nittatsu), I selected how all the characters Ross did know how to inscribe appeared on this Gohonzon. In lieu of what characters he didn't yet know how to inscribe, Ross fashioned \"fake\"\u200b writing in the background to fill in the gaps and make the Gohonzon appear natural. Daddy always used to say as long as Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is written down the center, it's a Gohonzon. Owner (I co-wrote much of the church's literature - with Bert Fields or Ross Dreiblatt) Church of Scientology International April 1966  \u2013 Present (49 years 4 months) Los Angeles, California At the beginning of the 1970s, I traveled around the Caribbean together with Johnny Depp on a ship captained by my biological father, L. Ron Hubbard. At other times in my early childhood, I was treated violently and deprived of all food and water by the sea org. Her Holiness the Dalai Lama The Country of Tibet October 1966  \u2013 Present (48 years 10 months) Tibet Daddy (Josei Toda a.k.a. Bert Fields) was also the Dalai Lama, but he did not wish to hold that title. Thus, other men carry this title to this very day. In 1966, Daddy had me tested by Tibetan authorities and I am the only child who passed this test. In the various articles placed before me, I picked out every single one of the articles that belonged to the previous Dalai Lama. But, because I was a girl, they decided to allow the man whom everyone currently reveres as the Dalai Lama to retain his fake title. High Priestess Claire Daishonin / Dragon Girl / Shakabuku Queen / Owner (inscribed Nikken Gohonzon) Nichiren Shoshu July 1979  \u2013 Present (36 years 1 month) Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan Daddy (Josei Toda a.k.a. Bert Fields) was also 66th High Priest Nittatsu: his disguise. Both \"Real Daddy\"\u200b (Toda) and \"Fake Daddy\"\u200b (the man born as Bert Fields, my biological father many times over) wore the disguise of 66th High Priest Nittatsu. And it was Fake Daddy who got murdered in July 1979 wearing this disguise. Real Daddy wouldn't die until he calmly committed suicide on October 12, 1985 (my birthday is October 21 and he supposedly died in 1958) after legally adopting me and marrying me off three consecutive times. \n \nI inscribed the Nikken Gohonzon in all its entirety 1974 when I was staying in Vega at age 8. Actually, I didn't paint the two flower stems to the left and right of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo until I was back on earth and couldn't remember anything. This Gohonzon got my perfect, final draft versions while the Nichikan Gohonzon to be distributed by the SGI got my sloppy, first draft versions of these flower stems. \n \nMy mother, Anne, drew the flower stems to the left and right of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo on the Nittatsu Gohonzon when she was 13-years-old. Like me, she is a biological daughter of SGI President Daisaku Ikeda. The father I grew up with, Dennis Wayne Elliott (my biological uncle), is the biological son of Nikken. One of my biological fathers is also a biological son of Nikken. \n \nWhen I first filed for divorce from my triplet brother \"Mickey\"\u200b Osvaldo Serafin Boitel (I still didn't remember he was my brother) in Santa Monica, California on November 27, 1991, Nikken followed suit by ex-communicating the entire SGI organization as soon as the sun came up in Japan on November 28, 1991. \n \nI am the legal 67th High Priest(ess) of Nichiren Shoshu. Daddy picked ME, not my biological grandpa/biological brother Nikken!  Founder / President / Owner Liberty First Bank (refer to George Walton Academy) March 1969  \u2013 Present (46 years 5 months) Monroe, Georgia To this day, Dawn Griffin pretends to be president of this bank. She got me arrested when she showed police her business card which lists her as president and CEO. She is just CEO! Always have I been president... since the time that we opened George Walton Academy in 1969. Hugh Brooster Williamson (a.k.a. Bruce Williamson of Liberty First Bank) will remember me at this school's opening ceremony. He was the bratty boy running around while Daddy and I were speaking to his father, one of the founders of this school. \n \nI personally visited this bank shortly after it opened to re-introduce myself to Bruce Williamson and meet another key official I was told to connect with. I was rudely told that they couldn't help me because I didn't hold any account at their bank. By phone, Dawn had warned me not to come, but I came anyway. I told them my maiden name was Claire Elliott, but Bruce was the one who pointed out that my name was no longer Claire Elliott (at the time, I thought that I had legally changed my name to Claire Cruise, but it was still legally Claire Boitel). \n \nDaddy wanted me to be president of MY money. In 1974, I diligently planned this bank together with Ross Dreiblatt. It is the headquarters for all MY money. \n \nDawn is NOT president of MY bank and I plan to take legal action when everything gets underway. \n \nDawn is the reason I went to jail (Walton County Jail) in October 2009 and suffered there for 9 grueling months until I could be transferred to a mental hospital in Augusta, Georgia (East Central Regional Hospital) in June 2010. I suffered there for another grueling year and half before I was conditionally released in November 2011. Finally was I fully released in October 2014. \n \nMy charges: False Statements and Writings and Computer Forgery. All for changing all the bank officer names to my name at the Georgia Secretary of State website just as Ross Dreiblatt and Daddy told me to do.  \n \nI had no choice but to plead Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity.

Founder / President / Owner Fortress Group, Inc. August 2000  \u2013 Present (15 years) Atlanta, Georgia Managed by my high school sweetheart/double-ex-fiance/biological nephew Chris Caputo and my good friend from high school/Chris's best friend from high school/my biological cousin/MY Grandma Flanagan's \"next-of-kin,\"\u200b Bruce Williamson. Unlike Hugh Brooster Williamson (a.k.a. Bruce Williamson of Liberty First Bank), Bruce's name has always been Bruce (yeah, he's the original Bruce Williamson... even if he's younger). My grandma intentionally chose Bruce to be her next-of-kin because she didn't know him and he was younger than me. She quickly met him exactly one time at Christmas time when he was 15 and then she was murdered by my mother, Anne, not long afterwards on April 9, 1982. The whole point is that she intended this money for solely ME: her biological daughter who grew up as her granddaughter. Josei Toda a.k.a. Bert Fields a.k.a. Nichiren Shoshu 66th High Priest Nittatsu planned everything. In the 1950s, he entrusted the principal of this fortune to Grandma Flanagan after they had had a red, hot love affair that was to culminate in the creation of a love child: ME.  \n \nI am the reincarnation of Josei Toda and this money is MINE. \n \nEven though I am the love of their life, both Chris Caputo and MY Bruce Williamson successfully obtained a permanent restraining order against me in Atlanta, Georgia on October 15, 2009: the day before I was arrested and thrown in jail by Liberty First Bank in Monroe, Georgia on October 16, 2009. \n \nThus, I will not be permitted to speak to any media outlet about any Fortress company or Chris or Bruce. \n \nWhen we were in high school, none of us knew that we were related. Both boys attended The Lawrenceville School (only for boys back then) in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. They are members of the class of 1983. \n \nBruce is absolutely terrified that I will tell everyone that he raped me. Yes, Bruce and Chris raped me, but so did so many other people. As the result, I have many naturally conceived babies with both Chris and Bruce. Founder / President / Owner Fortress Williamson Securities, Inc. August 2000  \u2013 Present (15 years) Atlanta, Georgia To be clear: Bruce Alan Williamson and Christopher Joseph Caputo both manage MY money headquartered at Liberty First Bank. I personally hired Chris Caputo in 1994. Precisely according to plan, my Grandma Flanagan never formed a trust - she just had a public fake will and a secret real will. Because she knew all that I was going through and would go through, it was her wish that I wait until I was 50-years-old before claiming all this money. 50-years-old! See Fortress Group, Inc. *I should add that Margaret Mitchell was one of my grandma's many alternate personas. Because she was from Vega, my grandma waited until she was 35 to inherit her place on the world stage... and, at age 35, she found that she wasn't ready for it at all. As Margaret Mitchell, a lifelong resident of Atlanta and the author of \"Gone with the Wind,\"\u200b Grandma lost her privacy and freedom and never stopped hating the moment she decided to write her famous novel in the first place. She wanted so much better for me. That's why she insisted that I lead as normal a life as possible until the age of 50. It was her opinion that 50 (not 40 as I previously remembered it to be) was \"a really good age.\" So you can blame Grandma for making me put everything on hold until now: the time when she thought I would be fully ready to claim my money and my life. I will be 50 in less than 3 months (today is 7/28/2015)! Founder / President / Owner Williamson Advisors, Inc.

Anthony had just been diagnosed with AIDS after being HIV+ for years. His intention was to impregnate me and infect me with HIV. I carried this virus for years and didn't know it. David Wayne Craig tested me to see if I tested positive not long after he had Anthony Lee rape me. I tested negative. But when I escaped to Las Vegas in January 2002, my new boyfriend, John Martinez, found out that he was HIV+ after we broke up and died of AIDS at the end of 2006. Then, another person who raped me at my cottage in Glendale, California - Mark Koral - became HIV+. I believe, to this day, Mark continues to live with the virus.  \n \nThank goodness the rape temporarily stopped (due to my homelessness) and I was not sexually active for 6 consecutive years. That's why no other people were infected by me. When I could finally remember everything to put it all together in August 2006, I quickly got myself tested, but still did I test negative for anti-bodies. I was told that I could go to a testing center in the valley (LA) where they test for the virus, itself. It's a more expensive test, but it is required of everyone in the porn industry because it takes a little time for a body to develop anti-bodies once the virus enters the body. I took this test, but, to my great surprise, I was negative. Somehow, someway my body had rid itself of HIV. Then, after I figured out that my ex-boyfriend, David Wayne Craig, had raped me while I was soundly sleeping behind a building in Santa Monica in September 2006, I became concerned that he might have intentionally re-infected me (I thought I might have made him HIV+). So, I left the long-term live-in battered women's program at a homeless shelter in Atlanta to visit this center in person in early 2008 for the purpose of getting re-tested. To my great surprise, I remained negative.

Advanced secret time technologies enable me to co-exist with my many, many alternate personas - most of whom I portrayed when I was 8-years-old.  \n \nAdvanced embryonic technologies enable cloning and the implantation of all my many embryos. My naturally conceived babies are considered more valuable than my DNA babies, explaining why I was raped so much. My naturally conceived babies are in the highest demand. \n \nI do not know if I can naturally conceive babies anymore. Because my periods have severely slowed down, I gather that I am going through menopause. However, my husband and I continue to use contraception because we can't afford to have a baby at this time. Always have they taken my embryos from me, anyway. Never have I tested positive on any pregnancy test (that I know of), but I have been pregnant more times than I can count.  \n \nThey leave my naturally conceived embryos inside me for about a month before they safely remove them - either the old fashioned way by injecting a liquid substance into my uterus to have it \"spit out\"\u200b my embryo into a test tube or by \"beaming up\"\u200b my embryo. They can implant another uterus with my embryo with techniques known today or by \"beaming down\"\u200b the embryo. \n \nThere is a physical apparatus that resembles a tanning bed that a person lays inside of in order to go into a different body (an alternate persona). You can enter this different body in an embryonic state to be born that person or you can become a body double of a person already born. I was not born Daisaku Ikeda or Tom Cruise, but I was their body doubles. I am the Daisaku who is the scholar, prolific writer and world peace leader whom everyone hopefully loves and I am the famous Tom Cruise whom everyone definitely loves. The other Daisaku Ikeda is father and husband to the Ikeda family and the other Tom Cruise is the boy who died of dehydration in his family's basement in 1975. \n \n Co-Songwriter (with Bert Fields or Ross Dreiblatt) The Beatles, Elton John, Billy Joel, Queen, Madonna, The Eagles, Hall & Oates, ABBA,The Police, etc. April 1966  \u2013  August 1974  (8 years 5 months) Vega A few of our songs were co-written after this in 1984, 1994 and 2001. I co-wrote the Beatles and some other songs with Daddy. Michael Jackson (my alternate persona/1st biological son) married me on my 18th birthday when my mother, Anne, failed to take me to the bank as she promised my Grandma Flanagan. He did this so he could purchase my half of the Beatles Catalogue (as well as continue taking credit for some of my songs which I co-wrote with Ross Dreiblatt).

The reason for this is that doctors injected my mom, Anne, with so much heroin (she also drank much hard liquor during her pregnancy with us) that layers of our DNA were literally burnt off, causing us to more resemble my biological children.

Nichikan Gohonzon) Soka Gakkai International January 1975  \u2013 Present (40 years 7 months) Tokyo, Japan Remember, my daddy is second Soka Gakkai President Josei Toda a.k.a. Bert Fields. At a certain point in my early childhood, Daddy asked me if I minded if he make his alternate persona, Bert Fields, his new identity. Of course I approved (it is Bert who is my biological father many times over). But Daddy is not the man who was born Bert Fields. For years there were two Bert Fields: Daddy (Josei Toda) whom I referred to as \"Real Daddy\"\u200b and the man who was born Bert Fields whom I referred to as \"Fake Daddy.\"\u200b Daddy also raised Ross Dreiblatt, someone he adopted at birth, but he raised Ross in Vega. Daddy calmly committed suicide on October 12, 1985 (my birthday is October 21 and he supposedly died in 1958) after I was married for the third consecutive time. Before doing so, however, he officially adopted me not long after I moved to NYC in 1984 when I was 18. Vega is where he continues to operate from. \n \nFYI: Vega (a.k.a. Heaven) is a physical location inside the sun.  \n \nThird Soka Gakkai President and SGI President Daisaku Ikeda is one of my many alternate personas whom I portrayed when I was 8-years-old. That is the exact, same age as the Dragon Girl of the Lotus Sutra who demonstrated to the entire Buddhist assembly the full extent of her enlightenment in one instant by taking on many forms, including that of a man. Refer to Burton Watson's version of the Lotus Sutra for more information. \n \nThe Nichikan Gohonzon was inscribed by Ross Dreiblatt before he knew how to properly inscribe a Gohonzon. Under the direction of Daddy (Josei Toda a.k.a. Bert Fields a.k.a. 66th High Priest Nittatsu), I selected how all the characters Ross did know how to inscribe appeared on this Gohonzon. In lieu of what characters he didn't yet know how to inscribe, Ross fashioned \"fake\"\u200b writing in the background to fill in the gaps and make the Gohonzon appear natural. Daddy always used to say as long as Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is written down the center, it's a Gohonzon. Dragon Girl / Shakabuku Queen / Founder / President / Owner (designed/co-inscrib.

Her Holiness the Dalai Lama The Country of Tibet October 1966  \u2013 Present (48 years 10 months) Tibet Daddy (Josei Toda a.k.a. Bert Fields) was also the Dalai Lama, but he did not wish to hold that title. Thus, other men carry this title to this very day. In 1966, Daddy had me tested by Tibetan authorities and I am the only child who passed this test. In the various articles placed before me, I picked out every single one of the articles that belonged to the previous Dalai Lama. But, because I was a girl, they decided to allow the man whom everyone currently reveres as the Dalai Lama to retain his fake title.

Bert Fields) was also 66th High Priest Nittatsu: his disguise. Both \"Real Daddy\"\u200b (Toda) and \"Fake Daddy\"\u200b (the man born as Bert Fields, my biological father many times over) wore the disguise of 66th High Priest Nittatsu. And it was Fake Daddy who got murdered in July 1979 wearing this disguise.

Actually, I didn't paint the two flower stems to the left and right of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo until I was back on earth and couldn't remember anything.

Like me, she is a biological daughter of SGI President Daisaku Ikeda. The father I grew up with, Dennis Wayne Elliott (my biological uncle), is the biological son of Nikken.

Founder / President / Owner Liberty First Bank (refer to George Walton Academy) March 1969  \u2013 Present (46 years 5 months) Monroe, Georgia To this day, Dawn Griffin pretends to be president of this bank. She got me arrested when she showed police her business card which lists her as president and CEO. She is just CEO! Always have I been president... since the time that we opened George Walton Academy in 1969. Hugh Brooster Williamson (a.k.a. Bruce Williamson of Liberty First Bank) will remember me at this school's opening ceremony. He was the bratty boy running around while Daddy and I were speaking to his father, one of the founders of this school. \n \nI personally visited this bank shortly after it opened to re-introduce myself to Bruce Williamson and meet another key official I was told to connect with. I was rudely told that they couldn't help me because I didn't hold any account at their bank. By phone, Dawn had warned me not to come, but I came anyway. I told them my maiden name was Claire Elliott, but Bruce was the one who pointed out that my name was no longer Claire Elliott (at the time, I thought that I had legally changed my name to Claire Cruise, but it was still legally Claire Boitel). \n \nDaddy wanted me to be president of MY money. In 1974, I diligently planned this bank together with Ross Dreiblatt. It is the headquarters for all MY money. \n \nDawn is NOT president of MY bank and I plan to take legal action when everything gets underway. \n \nDawn is the reason I went to jail (Walton County Jail) in October 2009 and suffered there for 9 grueling months until I could be transferred to a mental hospital in Augusta, Georgia (East Central Regional Hospital) in June 2010. I suffered there for another grueling year and half before I was conditionally released in November 2011. Finally was I fully released in October 2014. \n \nMy charges: False Statements and Writings and Computer Forgery. All for changing all the bank officer names to my name at the Georgia Secretary of State website just as Ross Dreiblatt and Daddy told me to do.  \n \nI had no choice but to plead Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity.

She quickly met him exactly one time at Christmas time when he was 15 and then she was murdered by my mother, Anne, not long afterwards on April 9, 1982. The whole point is that she intended this money for solely ME: her biological daughter who grew up as her granddaughter. Josei Toda a.k.a. Bert Fields a.k.a.

August 2000  \u2013 Present (15 years) Atlanta, Georgia To be clear: Bruce Alan Williamson and Christopher Joseph Caputo both manage MY money headquartered at Liberty First Bank. I personally hired Chris Caputo in 1994. Precisely according to plan, my Grandma Flanagan never formed a trust - she just had a public fake will and a secret real will. Because she knew all that I was going through and would go through, it was her wish that I wait until I was 50-years-old before claiming all this money. 50-years-old! See Fortress Group, Inc. *I should add that Margaret Mitchell was one of my grandma's many alternate personas. Because she was from Vega, my grandma waited until she was 35 to inherit her place on the world stage... and, at age 35, she found that she wasn't ready for it at all. As Margaret Mitchell, a lifelong resident of Atlanta and the author of \"Gone with the Wind,\"\u200b Grandma lost her privacy and freedom and never stopped hating the moment she decided to write her famous novel in the first place. She wanted so much better for me. That's why she insisted that I lead as normal a life as possible until the age of 50. It was her opinion that 50 (not 40 as I previously remembered it to be) was \"a really good age.\" So you can blame Grandma for making me put everything on hold until now: the time when she thought I would be fully ready to claim my money and my life.

Anthony had just been diagnosed with AIDS after being HIV+ for years. His intention was to impregnate me and infect me with HIV. I carried this virus for years and didn't know it. David Wayne Craig tested me to see if I tested positive not long after he had Anthony Lee rape me. I tested negative. But when I escaped to Las Vegas in January 2002, my new boyfriend, John Martinez, found out that he was HIV+ after we broke up and died of AIDS at the end of 2006. Then, another person who raped me at my cottage in Glendale, California - Mark Koral - became HIV+. I believe, to this day, Mark continues to live with the virus.  \n \nThank goodness the rape temporarily stopped (due to my homelessness) and I was not sexually active for 6 consecutive years. That's why no other people were infected by me. When I could finally remember everything to put it all together in August 2006, I quickly got myself tested, but still did I test negative for anti-bodies. I was told that I could go to a testing center in the valley (LA) where they test for the virus, itself. It's a more expensive test, but it is required of everyone in the porn industry because it takes a little time for a body to develop anti-bodies once the virus enters the body. I took this test, but, to my great surprise, I was negative. Somehow, someway my body had rid itself of HIV. Then, after I figured out that my ex-boyfriend, David Wayne Craig, had raped me while I was soundly sleeping behind a building in Santa Monica in September 2006, I became concerned that he might have intentionally re-infected me (I thought I might have made him HIV+). So, I left the long-term live-in battered women's program at a homeless shelter in Atlanta to visit this center in person in early 2008 for the purpose of getting re-tested. To my great surprise, I remained negative. The Cure for AIDS My body developed an immunity to HIV - never have I been HIV+ October 2000  \u2013  August 2006  (5 years 11 months) Various Locations HIV was introduced to my body when the actor, Anthony Lee, raped me just after my 35th b-day in 2000 (10/21) at my cottage in Glendale, California. Anthony had just been diagnosed with AIDS after being HIV+ for years. His intention was to impregnate me and infect me with HIV. I carried this virus for years and didn't know it. David Wayne Craig tested me to see if I tested positive not long after he had Anthony Lee rape me. I tested negative. But when I escaped to Las Vegas in January 2002, my new boyfriend, John Martinez, found out that he was HIV+ after we broke up and died of AIDS at the end of 2006. Then, another person who raped me at my cottage in Glendale, California - Mark Koral - became HIV+. I believe, to this day, Mark continues to live with the virus.  \n \nThank goodness the rape temporarily stopped (due to my homelessness) and I was not sexually active for 6 consecutive years. That's why no other people were infected by me.
