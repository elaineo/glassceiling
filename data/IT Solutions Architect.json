SWG Services WebSphere Consultant IBM January 2002  \u2013  December 2004  (3 years) During this period I combined two different functions, each for 50 percentage of my time. The WSBC framework is a business framework implemented with EJB technology. The mission consists of developing migration material (courses, \ndocumentation, and tools to automate migration). My role in this mission is focused on the course and documentation \ndevelopment. The tool used is the Integration Edition of WebSphere Studio Application Developer (WSIE). This work includes the development of an entire application based on the \nWSBC framework which is fully compliant with the J2EE standards. Business Partner Enablement consultant IBM December 1999  \u2013  December 2001  (2 years 1 month) The San Francisco support and consultants team, became proficient in the application technology of WebSphere before the product actually became a big success on the market place. I was perfectly fitting the role of consultant in the new support team targeting to enable business partners with WebSphere. At first the focus lied on application server technology, but is very soon extended towards other products (for instance WebSphere Edge Server) and technologies (J2EE) as they emerged. In my role as consultant I traveled throughout EMEA with a focus on the emerging markets (Poland, Slovakia, Serbia, Croatia, Czech Republic, ....) I worked as architect, as analyst, as mentor and as instructor on several engagements. \nIn order to support the enablement mission the entire team developed a unique course for educational purposes. I developed several client architectures to illustrate the basic \nprinciples to our business partners. San Francisco Project Consultant IBM January 1998  \u2013  December 1999  (2 years) Taking this job, I became full IBM employee. I worked as a level2 support person for the IBM San Francisco project. This was an EMEA level function for which frequent travel to the Rochester laboratories was required. The second year of this mission, I became team leader of the support team. I had to handle the work distribution, the reporting requirements, the external communications and audits. In this role I worked closely with the peer teams in the USA and in Asia. I became for instance experienced in organizing 24 hours-support cycles, in which urgent problems are dealt with around the clock by different teams in different time zones.
