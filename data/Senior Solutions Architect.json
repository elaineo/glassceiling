My year off has been a real life saver and I feel tippitty top of my game. What, you may ask, have I been filling my hours with - well aside from the small matter of my new daughter, Cristina Pixel, and yes, she is indeed pixel perfect, I have been doing research, reading books, watching trees grow, changing nappies, growing exasperated at the training response of Daisy the golden retriever, re-inventing bathrooms, building apps, coaxing new teeth to grow, retraining, cooking and generally putting my head into a really good place.  Technical / Experience architect Rufus Leonard October 2012  \u2013  August 2014  (1 year 11 months) London, United Kingdom My role at Rufus meant taking control of digital endeavours from the meet and greet right up to the delivery beers. As with all of my roles keeping a strong focus on both technical / creative and UX \n \nLot's of interesting clients and projects, main technological areas included solutions with Sitecore, EPiServer, Reddot, mobile apps and of course a lot of responsive stuff going on. Never a dull moment. Seriously though, never !!!
