managing EHS environmental programs. As Intel Corporation's Green Building Program Manager I am responsible for ensuring the implementation of Intel's policy that all new buildings be designed to LEED NC Gold. I was the Project Manager and Program Owner for the Silver-level certification of the Intel Ocotillo Campus in Chandler, Arizona under LEED EBOM, which is the first existing building LEED certification awarded to a semiconductor manufacturing campus. Using that experience I have successfully guided other LEED EBOM projects to achieve certification, including the Intel Jerusalem wafer fabrication plant which has received LEED Platinum. I have been involved in the project teams design and construction of Intel\u2019s newest manufacturing plants all of which which received LEED NC Gold. I successfully proposed to the USGBC the initiation of a manufacturers user group (LUGIF). The mission of the MUG is to establish a collaborative community of peers that work together to identify, share, and publicize best practices related to the design, operations and maintenance of green manufacturing facilities. The group is now in its 2nd year. I have documented alternative compliance paths for the LUGIF and provided successful credit interpretation requests or alternative compliance paths for Intel certification projects.  \n \nI have managed all of the site environmental programs for a large volume high tech manufacturing campus; including chemical waste, solid waste, LEED, waste water and air program.
