Not numbers. Not in cool little shapes and doodles, but marketing. It's my paintbrush. My language. I was once told, \"Toy, I swear. You watch commercials more than you watch the actual show.\" At the time, I was an aspiring journalist who had no clue that marketing was part of my DNA.  \n \nFor me, I absolutely get a kick out of helping clients understand the voice of their brand through the voice of their target audience and a thoughtful content/communications strategy. Helping them reach that eureka moment is equivalent to a doctor handing a new mom and dad their baby for the very first time. In marketing, it's at that very moment that a client \"gets it\" that I can truly build a marketing strategy and content-based framework that helps them truly reach their audience through all the necessary channels. From \"tip to tail,\" I love to outline a solid strategy and execute all the marketing tactics that drive results, while mapping back to the business goal.  \n \nIf you need a marketer who sees the world in marketing and has a knack for telling a great story, I'm the marketer for you. I'm analytical, research-oriented, customer-centric and deadline driven. At the end of the day, it's key that I work with those who - like me - have a diverse set of skills and share my drive to deliver stellar, memorable work that excites the stakeholder and their intended audience.

You watch commercials more than you watch the actual show.\" At the time, I was an aspiring journalist who had no clue that marketing was part of my DNA.  \n \nFor me, I absolutely get a kick out of helping clients understand the voice of their brand through the voice of their target audience and a thoughtful content/communications strategy. Helping them reach that eureka moment is equivalent to a doctor handing a new mom and dad their baby for the very first time. In marketing, it's at that very moment that a client \"gets it\" that I can truly build a marketing strategy and content-based framework that helps them truly reach their audience through all the necessary channels. From \"tip to tail,\" I love to outline a solid strategy and execute all the marketing tactics that drive results, while mapping back to the business goal.  \n \nIf you need a marketer who sees the world in marketing and has a knack for telling a great story, I'm the marketer for you. I'm analytical, research-oriented, customer-centric and deadline driven. At the end of the day, it's key that I work with those who - like me - have a diverse set of skills and share my drive to deliver stellar, memorable work that excites the stakeholder and their intended audience.
