Executive IT architect, IBM Public Sector, IBM Malaysia Sdn Bhd November 1982  \u2013 Present (32 years 10 months) Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia In my current position, I cover most of the developing /growth countries in the world from a pre-sales perspective of qualifying opportunities, bringing technical expertise and government domain expertise to structure, shape and provide solutions that can be implemented.  \n \nThe increasingly open and competitive nature of governments, the pressure to exchange and share data, an increasingly vocal and knowledgeable citizen base, and the rate of change forced by changing demographics, the need to compete globally, to meet economic and population demands, coupled with the ever-changing rate of technology, gives life to the old Chinese phrase \"May you live in interesting times!\" \n \nI specialise in the public sector domain, where requirements are often national-type systems with large legacy systems, databases, and large numbers of users. Data migration, integration, infrastructure overhaul, process and organisational change usually figure in the mix somewhere.
