Experience Senior Developer IBM December 2012  \u2013 Present (2 years 9 months) At IBM, I work on a team of 12 people developing a web application used for logistics support. The application has a Javascript front-end using multiple libraries including JQuery, MooTools, and Knockout. Our back-end consists of an ReST services layer implemented using EJBs (JavaEE 6), with data stored in a variety of supported databases including Oracle, PostreSQL, and Derby. My main tasks on a day-to-day basis for this application are API design, architectural analysis, and development. \n \nIn addition to this application, I work on the Architectural Design and Review Board. This group is responsible for analyzing customer requirements and deciding upon the best solution given the state of our current systems. We will decide if the requirements are already met by an existing application, if a COTS product would be more cost-efficient, or, if development is required, which technologies should be used and which skill sets are needed. This is finished by an estimate of the rough order of magnitude for the task. \n \nI also work to maintain and develop enterprise libraries used throughout our organization, and I have recently started mentoring new hires for Java Developer positions.

In addition, we provide training for the other developers in our organization for general programming, programming techniques, and tools which make us more efficient at our jobs. As a member of this group I help others adhere to best practices and provide code reviews and advice. \n \nResearch and develop new technologies to improve our processes and abilities as an organization. We use a large suite of tools including Maven, Ant, JIRA, Jenkins, Confluence, Code Collaborator, SoapUI, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Oracle (BEA) Weblogic, Oracle Database, Oracle Service Bus, and TOAD for Oracle. \n \nDesigned and implemented enterprise library for displaying and exporting data configurations in multiple formats using a combination of custom JSF components and an extendible report architecture.

Consultant Ultimate Distribution Inc February 1999  \u2013  August 2000  (1 year 7 months) Project: Web-enable legacy applications.  \nRe-engineering of legacy \"green-screen\" RPG applications for web access. Rewrote a number of RPG programs as ASP (Active Server Pages) using VBScript for server-side processing, Javascript for client-side validation, and ADO for access to DB2/400 database using SQL. \nRelated to above, also redesigned some RPG interactive programs to run as services to web applications with the purpose of preserving existing business logic. Providing this functionality also yielded the added benefit of allowing access to data in flat files left over from old S/36 applications.  \nRedesigned/wrote new applications to run on WebSphere using JSPs, servlets, EJBs and HTML, conforming to the model-view-controller design pattern. Application delivery over thin clients was a high-priority requirement because the majority of the user's customer base are behind corporate firewalls set up with strict security policies. \nDeveloped interfaces to mail and fax servers to enable web and AS/400 applications to deliver information requested by customers through the web applications.  \n \nDevelopment tools used:  \nJava, SQL, Visual InterDev 6.0, Frontpage 2000, VisualAge for Java Enterprise, AS/400 Java Toolbox, JDK 1.1.7 and 1.2, Websphere Studio, Enterprise Architect (for OOD UML design).

Some examples: \n \nTwo-way data transfer between MS Office applications and AS/400 database (using AS/400 Client Access tools). \nA Monitoring application requiring information delivery using the airline terminal model (application access without user interaction). This application required implementation of a remote data queue function not available on the AS/400 at that time. Back-end was CICS, DB2. Industry type was insurance. \nInterface between voice-response system and AS/400 application (service provider inquiry for insurance company).  \nMessage transfer from/to AIX (RS/6000) application controlling industrial robots. \nData transfer interface to custom mainframe manufacturing application (MVS, CICS). Provided API for application programmers to initiate transfers and check status. \nRemote data queue function to transfer data between AS/400 and S/36 applications. This application implemented a store and forward model because of requirement to run over unreliable communications facilities. Senior Developer NYNEX January 1996  \u2013  October 1996  (10 months) Design and implementation of AS/400 based system to provide data base access services to a Call/Path application interacting with voice response units.  \nUsed system API's to implement various control and data transfer functions (user spaces, user queues, MI, etc.) to meet sub-second response time requirements.  \nWrote servers for remote client access using CPI-C (LU6.2 based conversational protocol) and Sockets (BSD 4.3). Primary language used was ILE/C \nDeveloped the remote client for above (sockets) to run in AIX. \n \nDevelopment tools used: ILE/C, SQL/400. \n \n \n(1995 and prior) \n \nConsulting assignments for fortune 500 companies in various industries. Many of these assignments involved interfacing AS/400 applications with applications on a number of different platforms running the range from desktops to mainframe (MVS, CICS, VM).
