Experience Undergrad Software Engineering Intern Intel Corporation June 2015  \u2013 Present (3 months) Folsom, California Utilizing the robust programming language of Python, and more specifically, the PyVisa library, I am automating several engineering tools(oscilloscope, network analyzer, external power supply). Through enabling the automation of these tools, I have saved many hours of, what would be, in-person debugging on computer memory technologies. \n \nI am also in charge of low power DDR3 and DDR4 memory test execution, as well as automating the validation and failure characterization of those devices. The automation is done via a Python program which parses the log file and organizes the data in a logical and easy to understand matter. The program then produces a very readable excel report.

After I graduated high school my position changed to a software engineering undergrad intern. Between the various groups i interned with, I learned a lot of technical and soft skills. \n \nSome achievements are: \n\u2022 Obtained a United States Government security clearance in order to \nautomate classified XML data retrieval and testing, using Java. \n\u2022 Helped to create a streamlined Linux development environment that nearly \neliminated the lengthy process of setting up a working environment for the \ntarget hardware. \n\u2022 Wrote a front-end in Java for the UCC (Unified Code Count) tool, which \nhelped to drastically reduce user interaction time amongst team members. \n\u2022 Wrote Python scripts that simulated communication between a Rockwell \nCollins product and an airport\u2019s ground control which helped release the \nproduct within its intended schedule. \n\u2022 Participant of a select high school internship program from 2011 to 2012.
