Since 2004, I have lived with my wife, Linda, in Buffalo Valley, Tennessee, about one hour East of Nashville, TN. \n \nDuring my assignment as a consultant, I have had the pleasure of working with several major companies throughout the world in a variety of industries, including some of the largest banks in the world in China, Brazil, Australia, Germany, the United States and Canada.  \n \nIn my engagements I see several IT challenges in managing systems and services for High Availability. I believe there is significant opportunity for IT process improvements, especially in establishing appropriate KPIs to drive desired behavior and continuous improvements to enhance process effectiveness and efficiency.  \n \nJust some of the common challenges I see are: \n- IT shops are internally focused with little understanding of business requirements and cost of downtime. Service Level Objectives are non-specific and not focused on what is most important to the business. \n- Incomplete Configuration Management database. \u201c If you don't know what you have, how do you manage it?\u201d \n- Disjointed component monitoring with no correlation to service events. \nIncident Management is really crisis management with little or no focus on preventing incidents and crises.  \n- Problem solving stops too soon with defect analysis and does not progress to true Root Cause Analysis. Currently, within the IT industry, Root Cause is largely a 'buzz word', limiting the ability to proactively prevent problems.  \n- Change Management is bureaucratic change control and not an enabler of high quality change.
