Joined a startup for the first web boom-bust cycle (Alibaba competitor). Moved on to part-time code consulting and studies in Informatics and Systems Design. Went on an exchange to UC San Diego and studied Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction. Returned to Sweden to do a Masters in the same. Focused on using eye tracking to control computers. Led to a PhD program at the ITU Copenhagen where I developed gaze-driven interfaces and concepts such as eye controlled robots. Took up an offer from Stanford University to work with eye tracking in Radiology. Developed a custom research platform and decided to stay on as Research Associate. Relocated with the job to Duke University. Stayed in touch with the fellow eye tracking experts in Copenhagen and continued co-developing the ITU Gaze Tracker.
