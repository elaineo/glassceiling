Experience Senior Software Engineer (Platform) Infusionsoft November 2014  \u2013 Present (10 months) Towards the end of 2014 we started working on building a platform composed of multiple services. This is an effort to build a solid and stable foundation that can be leveraged by our flagship application. My major accomplishments in this are have been: \n \n- Designed and implemented a script-execution service that uses Nashorn and Java 8. This allows developers to write scripts in Groovy or JavaScript, which are then executed in a sandboxed environment. The application uses a Cassandra database. \n- Currently designing and implementing an extensions repository to maintain and vend extensions. The service exposes a Level 3 REST API with semantic media-types and adheres to HATEOAS. The service also uses a Cassandra database. This is a long-term project with significant impact and benefit. \n- Did further work on documenting our internal best-practices for RESTful APIs. \n- Involved in designing and codifying our interview-process for Software Engineers. Also involved in interviewing potential candidates for Infusionsoft's software-development team. \n- Involved in developer-education efforts. \n- Presented at Desert Code Camp on REST and RESTful APIs. Senior Software Engineer (Continuous Delivery) Infusionsoft January 2014  \u2013  November 2014  (11 months) In 2014 we started focusing more on continuous delivery and on platform architecture. The architecture team was reorganized to pivot around this strategy. My major accomplishments with my team in continuous delivery were: \n \n- Educated and providing documentation and training for our move from Subversion to Git. \n- Researched and learned about various continuous-delivery best-practices. \n- Documented API best practices. \n- Documented REST best practices, including proper REST API development with regard to design and versioning and promoting the use of semantic media-types (HATEOAS).  \n- Designed and implemented an end-to-end development and deployment solution to help developers to stand up services easily (with a prescribed stack) and deploy the service as well. \n- Designed and implemented a configuration-management system (Spring 3 + Java 7) and associated API and SDK. Software Architect Infusionsoft July 2012  \u2013  January 2014  (1 year 7 months) I moved to the Architecture team in the middle of 2012 because I was interested in taking on a role with more challenges and that allowed me to focus on problems with the entire app instead of a single functional-area. I was interested in scalability and performance issues, and I was also looking for ways to refactor and improve legacy frameworks within our flagship application. \n \nMy major accomplishments in this role were: \n \n- Standardizing our binary data-storage framework by developing a uniform interface for the entire flagship application. Using this data-storage it was possible to write to S3 and the database at the same time. \n- Augmented the new framework I had create to write data out to a NAS instead of the database. Due to my modular design in the framework I had created, it was trivial to swap out the database for the NAS since the framework wasn't tightly coupled to any particular storage-strategy. \n- Developed an integration between QUnit and TestNG which allowed developers to run client-side QUnit tests alongside TestNG tests during the build process.  \n- Developed a standalone screenshotting service (built around PhantomJS) that our flagship could use to generate screenshots of user-generated content. This application is still deployed and running and has scaled pretty well with our increasing load. \n- Undertook measures to increase developer awareness of best-practices and code quality. \n- Implemented a solution to generate semantically-valid and optimal JOIN statements for our custom query-builder (this was a stop-gap measure until we moved to a proper standard). Prior to improvement, the query builder would generate inefficient JOIN-statements even if all fields weren't requested. My solution took into account the fields that were passed in and would generate an optimal JOIN statement taking transitive JOINS into account as well. \n- Presented at Desert Code Camp on our integration between QUnit and TestNG. Software Engineer Infusionsoft January 2008  \u2013  July 2012  (4 years 7 months) I started off by working on Internal Features and then gradually moved to more customer-facing work. Eventually I became part of the eCommerce team where I continued more feature work and also performed successful integrations with merchant accounts and a shipping integrations with UPS. After a brief stint with the Architecture team (while eCommerce was on hiatus) where I worked with senior developers on framework-related code that have a bearing on the architecture of our codebase as a whole, I moved back to the eCommerce team. This time, I worked on refactoring our existing codebase for the sake of improving maintainability and quality. I also worked on implementing new features like improved payment processing, better order forms, and a better shopping cart. I also frequently performed and accomplish tasks that were outside or above my role. \n \nMy major accomplishments in this role were: \n \n- Developed internal frameworks for eCommerce. \n- Developed integrations with third-party services like UPS and Merchant Accounts. \n- Standardized country and province codes in our application to use ISO-3166 standards \n- Developed client-side components and frameworks (in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) \n- Wrote XSD schemas to validate our API-definition XML-document. \n- Wrote XSLT transforms to generate API documentation from out API-definition XML-document. \n- Investigated and identified code-compliation slowdown issues with Maven, and submitted an issue to the Maven project (I was able to build a patched version that we could use until the official release came out) \n- Investigated the use of Grinder for performance testing, and developed a performance-testing framework. \n- Mentored fellow developers. \n- Presented on various topics to support developer learning. \n- Facilitated moving our codebase over to Java 7 was Java 6 was nearing end-of-life. \n- Helped develop a new version of our shopping-cart and payment-processing system. Sergeant (Automated Logistics and Supplies Specialist) Army National Guard December 2000  \u2013  December 2009  (9 years 1 month) Tempe, AZ; Phoenix, AZ; Mesa, AZ; Baghdad, Iraq I joined the Arizona Army National Guard in December of '00. I finished basic training during the summer of '01 and AIT during the summer of '02. My responsibilities as a 92A involved managing motor-pool supplies using the Army's ULLS-G software. I was also responsible for other tasks such as returning serviceable parts, and managing HAZMAT. In August of '05, I was deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom for a year-long tour in Baghdad, Iraq. I was stationed at Camp Liberty. I was promoted while in country and managed one soldier who was under me. My tasks in country were similar; I managed inventory and supplies that helped our mechanics service our vehicles. I also kept track of serviceable parts, HAZMAT, and reporting. I was able to use my skills as a software engineer to streamline our efforts further. The ULLS-G Army software was not very intuitive, and was cumbersome to use. I was able to find an ODBC driver for the ULLS-G data files, and using that I wrote Perl scripts that automated a lot of my manual tasks. Our reporting to the battalion was done via Excel spread-sheets. I was able to use the same ODBC driver along with Excel Macros to ensure that we had the most-accurate reporting of all units in that battalion. For my efforts, I was awarded the Army Commendation Medal. Systems Validation Engineer Intel Corporation September 2004  \u2013  October 2007  (3 years 2 months) Chandler, AZ At Intel I was a Systems Validation Engineer. I developed and wrote test-plans that would help Intel validate new chipsets (specifically, Broadwater and Ironlake). I also wrote Linux drivers for new chipsets. I also looked for opportunities to increase the efficiency of existing tools. Intel had an existing application (in MS Access) that would download register specifications. This tool was not very performant, as it took around an hour or two for the query to complete. I wrote a Perl script that performed the same task in a few seconds. I also wrote scripts that autogenerated header-files and assembly programs using register specifications. Engineering Intern Motorola May 2003  \u2013  May 2004  (1 year 1 month) Tempe, AZ I worked at the Motorola Computer Group for about a year. Initially I was brought on to develop a project using ColdFusion, but I successfully convinced them to let me use PHP. I created a web-based application that helped developers at Motorola manage PTF's (Program Temporary Fix) that were used on AIX. The web application allowed developers to examine PTF dependencies and also to upload and modify existing PTF's. I also wrote a number of Perl scripts that enabled developers to do the same from the command-line. Programmer, Web Developer, Networks and Systems Administrator, ASU Arizona State University February 2003  \u2013  May 2003  (4 months) Tempe, AZ At ASU's International Programs Office, I had a whole host of duties. I was the Networks and Systems Administrator, Web Developer, and Programmer. Here, I mainly worked with PHP, Perl, HTML/CSS/Javascript, and Bash Shell scripts. I set up their network for them, with a FreeBSD Primary Domain Controller that had Windows Clients. I set up an automated backup system for them, and also set up their website. Programmer Arizona State University August 2000  \u2013  May 2002  (1 year 10 months) Tempe, AZ This was my first job, and my responsibilities initially consisted of providing tech support to MBA students and Programming at ASU's College of Business (now known as the W. P. Carey School of Business). About 6 months later. I exclusively started working on Programming. I mainly worked with ColdFusion, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was one of the original members of the \"Helpdesk Team\", where I was involved in the creation of the \"Helpdesk Ticketing Application\" for the ASU College of Business.

Senior Software Engineer (Continuous Delivery) Infusionsoft January 2014  \u2013  November 2014  (11 months) In 2014 we started focusing more on continuous delivery and on platform architecture. The architecture team was reorganized to pivot around this strategy. My major accomplishments with my team in continuous delivery were: \n \n- Educated and providing documentation and training for our move from Subversion to Git. \n- Researched and learned about various continuous-delivery best-practices. \n- Documented API best practices. \n- Documented REST best practices, including proper REST API development with regard to design and versioning and promoting the use of semantic media-types (HATEOAS).  \n- Designed and implemented an end-to-end development and deployment solution to help developers to stand up services easily (with a prescribed stack) and deploy the service as well. \n- Designed and implemented a configuration-management system (Spring 3 + Java 7) and associated API and SDK.

Software Architect Infusionsoft July 2012  \u2013  January 2014  (1 year 7 months) I moved to the Architecture team in the middle of 2012 because I was interested in taking on a role with more challenges and that allowed me to focus on problems with the entire app instead of a single functional-area. I was interested in scalability and performance issues, and I was also looking for ways to refactor and improve legacy frameworks within our flagship application. \n \nMy major accomplishments in this role were: \n \n- Standardizing our binary data-storage framework by developing a uniform interface for the entire flagship application. Using this data-storage it was possible to write to S3 and the database at the same time. \n- Augmented the new framework I had create to write data out to a NAS instead of the database. Due to my modular design in the framework I had created, it was trivial to swap out the database for the NAS since the framework wasn't tightly coupled to any particular storage-strategy. \n- Developed an integration between QUnit and TestNG which allowed developers to run client-side QUnit tests alongside TestNG tests during the build process.  \n- Developed a standalone screenshotting service (built around PhantomJS) that our flagship could use to generate screenshots of user-generated content. This application is still deployed and running and has scaled pretty well with our increasing load. \n- Undertook measures to increase developer awareness of best-practices and code quality. \n- Implemented a solution to generate semantically-valid and optimal JOIN statements for our custom query-builder (this was a stop-gap measure until we moved to a proper standard). Prior to improvement, the query builder would generate inefficient JOIN-statements even if all fields weren't requested. My solution took into account the fields that were passed in and would generate an optimal JOIN statement taking transitive JOINS into account as well. \n- Presented at Desert Code Camp on our integration between QUnit and TestNG.

Software Engineer Infusionsoft January 2008  \u2013  July 2012  (4 years 7 months) I started off by working on Internal Features and then gradually moved to more customer-facing work. Eventually I became part of the eCommerce team where I continued more feature work and also performed successful integrations with merchant accounts and a shipping integrations with UPS. After a brief stint with the Architecture team (while eCommerce was on hiatus) where I worked with senior developers on framework-related code that have a bearing on the architecture of our codebase as a whole, I moved back to the eCommerce team. This time, I worked on refactoring our existing codebase for the sake of improving maintainability and quality. I also worked on implementing new features like improved payment processing, better order forms, and a better shopping cart. I also frequently performed and accomplish tasks that were outside or above my role. \n \nMy major accomplishments in this role were: \n \n- Developed internal frameworks for eCommerce. \n- Developed integrations with third-party services like UPS and Merchant Accounts. \n- Standardized country and province codes in our application to use ISO-3166 standards \n- Developed client-side components and frameworks (in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) \n- Wrote XSD schemas to validate our API-definition XML-document. \n- Wrote XSLT transforms to generate API documentation from out API-definition XML-document. \n- Investigated and identified code-compliation slowdown issues with Maven, and submitted an issue to the Maven project (I was able to build a patched version that we could use until the official release came out) \n- Investigated the use of Grinder for performance testing, and developed a performance-testing framework. \n- Mentored fellow developers. \n- Presented on various topics to support developer learning. \n- Facilitated moving our codebase over to Java 7 was Java 6 was nearing end-of-life. \n- Helped develop a new version of our shopping-cart and payment-processing system.

Sergeant (Automated Logistics and Supplies Specialist) Army National Guard December 2000  \u2013  December 2009  (9 years 1 month) Tempe, AZ; Phoenix, AZ; Mesa, AZ; Baghdad, Iraq I joined the Arizona Army National Guard in December of '00. I finished basic training during the summer of '01 and AIT during the summer of '02. My responsibilities as a 92A involved managing motor-pool supplies using the Army's ULLS-G software. I was also responsible for other tasks such as returning serviceable parts, and managing HAZMAT. In August of '05, I was deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom for a year-long tour in Baghdad, Iraq. I was stationed at Camp Liberty. I was promoted while in country and managed one soldier who was under me. My tasks in country were similar; I managed inventory and supplies that helped our mechanics service our vehicles. I also kept track of serviceable parts, HAZMAT, and reporting. I was able to use my skills as a software engineer to streamline our efforts further. The ULLS-G Army software was not very intuitive, and was cumbersome to use. I was able to find an ODBC driver for the ULLS-G data files, and using that I wrote Perl scripts that automated a lot of my manual tasks. Our reporting to the battalion was done via Excel spread-sheets. I was able to use the same ODBC driver along with Excel Macros to ensure that we had the most-accurate reporting of all units in that battalion. For my efforts, I was awarded the Army Commendation Medal.

Systems Validation Engineer Intel Corporation September 2004  \u2013  October 2007  (3 years 2 months) Chandler, AZ At Intel I was a Systems Validation Engineer. I developed and wrote test-plans that would help Intel validate new chipsets (specifically, Broadwater and Ironlake). I also wrote Linux drivers for new chipsets. I also looked for opportunities to increase the efficiency of existing tools. Intel had an existing application (in MS Access) that would download register specifications. This tool was not very performant, as it took around an hour or two for the query to complete. I wrote a Perl script that performed the same task in a few seconds. I also wrote scripts that autogenerated header-files and assembly programs using register specifications.

Engineering Intern Motorola May 2003  \u2013  May 2004  (1 year 1 month) Tempe, AZ I worked at the Motorola Computer Group for about a year. Initially I was brought on to develop a project using ColdFusion, but I successfully convinced them to let me use PHP. I created a web-based application that helped developers at Motorola manage PTF's (Program Temporary Fix) that were used on AIX. The web application allowed developers to examine PTF dependencies and also to upload and modify existing PTF's. I also wrote a number of Perl scripts that enabled developers to do the same from the command-line.

Lead Software Developer The Chatfield Group April 2010  \u2013  June 2011  (1 year 3 months) Scottsdale, AZ Leading a team of 3 software developers at Ticketmaster, working on C++/C# GUI Software Development for a Call Center application. Systems Validation Engineer Intel Corporation May 2010  \u2013  September 2010  (5 months) Senior Software Engineer NthDegree Technologies Worldwide Inc August 2008  \u2013  November 2009  (1 year 4 months) As the sole software employee at a small startup, my tasks included software architecture and development of firmware, a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application, a website, and some IT. \n\u2022\tFirmware \u2013 Developed firmware for a electroluminescent (EL) paper controller on a Microchip PIC18F45K20 microcontroller. The controller delivered AC power to 12 independent channels in a dynamic user programmable method, using I2C data stored on an external EEPROM. Firmware incorporated a unique \u2018sign language\u2019 code, which controlled parameters such as lamp intensity, fading, time duration, and auto-sleep and used many of the microcontroller\u2019s peripherals, including timers, interrupts, switches, flash self-programming, and I2C data.  \n\u2022\tGUI \u2013 Architected and developed a .NET C# GUI to generate .hex files for the EL controller. The GUI was written using MS Visual Studio, and it could read/write sign files from a gridview, using a 2D grid timeline interface. The GUI could also import XML data and read it into timelines, where XML was generated from a Photoshop script. Thru color blending, and shorthand text, the GUI visually showed a user how a .hex file would look when it was displayed on a EL Controller. \n\u2022\tWebsite \u2013 Created a template-based E-commerce website using C#, ASP.NET, javascript, CSS, and a SQL database. The website could dynamically request shipping quotes from UPS and take credit cards thru Authorize.net. AJAX was used to add Cascading dropdowns for country and state inputs, allowing for international shipping thru the use of a .NET web service. Software Engineer II Apriva December 2007  \u2013  August 2008  (9 months) Ported secure email software from Windows Mobile 5.0 to a proprietary platform running Windows CE 5.0. Job duties included writing driver software for a smartcard reader, building a WinCE 5.0 OS from Microsoft\u2019s Platform Builder, high and low level debug of a MFC-based email program, and integration of new C++ code with 3 other platforms. Software Engineer Marvell December 2003  \u2013  November 2007  (4 years) Developed software tools to validate hardware and automate testing. One tool developed was a Windows C# GUI which controlled a serial port and a network power supply. The GUI could be operated in run-time mode with an interactive user in a dumb terminal setup, or the UART could be automated by user-written XML scripts. This application was coded entirely within the timeframe of 3 months. Programming challenges involved multi-threaded run-time operation, serial port control, GUI design, automation control, XML script reading/writing, and more. \n \nLed an effort to transform a small piece of ARM assembly and C boot code into a software tool similar to a command-line based operating system. Boot code was designed to allow a user to execute command-line test functions over a serial port interface. After completing the basic framework, I added C-coded tests for many of the individual devices on the Xscale chip, including: DMA, power management, interrupt management, memory and cache tests, UART, OS timers, and more. This program saw action debugging customer-returned silicon, leading to manufacturing software screens. \n \nDesigned and implemented a C++ Windows XP DLL which programs FPGAs thru an embedded VHDL module. This piece of software is essentially driver code which configures multiple FPGAs simultaneously thru a number of different interfaces, including parallel port, PCI bridge, PLX device, JTAG, SelectMap, and a proprietary bus interface. Systems Validation Engineer Intel January 2001  \u2013  December 2003  (3 years) Debugged a wide variety software failures on Intel random concurrency software. Failures included, improper test software setup, BIOS failures, and silicon logic bugs. Units debugged included interrupt controller, power management, LPC, LAN, CSA for gigabit ethernet, and system management. \n \nCoded an embedded DOS flash driver. In the process, this required reverse engineering a Windows driver to determine PCI configuration settings, developing a complex set of code to intermittently stop and resume operation while performing data reads and writes. Code was written in a combination of C and assembly. \n \nDeveloped a data pattern generation API in C for Linux-based concurrency test software. This API was nicknamed the \u201cmother of all pattern generators\u201d, and it gave users flexibility and performance.

Systems Validation Engineer Intel Corporation May 2010  \u2013  September 2010  (5 months) Systems Validation Engineer Intel Corporation May 2010  \u2013  September 2010  (5 months) Senior Software Engineer NthDegree Technologies Worldwide Inc August 2008  \u2013  November 2009  (1 year 4 months) As the sole software employee at a small startup, my tasks included software architecture and development of firmware, a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application, a website, and some IT. \n\u2022\tFirmware \u2013 Developed firmware for a electroluminescent (EL) paper controller on a Microchip PIC18F45K20 microcontroller. The controller delivered AC power to 12 independent channels in a dynamic user programmable method, using I2C data stored on an external EEPROM. Firmware incorporated a unique \u2018sign language\u2019 code, which controlled parameters such as lamp intensity, fading, time duration, and auto-sleep and used many of the microcontroller\u2019s peripherals, including timers, interrupts, switches, flash self-programming, and I2C data.  \n\u2022\tGUI \u2013 Architected and developed a .NET C# GUI to generate .hex files for the EL controller. The GUI was written using MS Visual Studio, and it could read/write sign files from a gridview, using a 2D grid timeline interface. The GUI could also import XML data and read it into timelines, where XML was generated from a Photoshop script. Thru color blending, and shorthand text, the GUI visually showed a user how a .hex file would look when it was displayed on a EL Controller. \n\u2022\tWebsite \u2013 Created a template-based E-commerce website using C#, ASP.NET, javascript, CSS, and a SQL database. The website could dynamically request shipping quotes from UPS and take credit cards thru Authorize.net. AJAX was used to add Cascading dropdowns for country and state inputs, allowing for international shipping thru the use of a .NET web service.

Software Engineer Marvell December 2003  \u2013  November 2007  (4 years) Developed software tools to validate hardware and automate testing. One tool developed was a Windows C# GUI which controlled a serial port and a network power supply. The GUI could be operated in run-time mode with an interactive user in a dumb terminal setup, or the UART could be automated by user-written XML scripts. This application was coded entirely within the timeframe of 3 months. Programming challenges involved multi-threaded run-time operation, serial port control, GUI design, automation control, XML script reading/writing, and more. \n \nLed an effort to transform a small piece of ARM assembly and C boot code into a software tool similar to a command-line based operating system. Boot code was designed to allow a user to execute command-line test functions over a serial port interface. After completing the basic framework, I added C-coded tests for many of the individual devices on the Xscale chip, including: DMA, power management, interrupt management, memory and cache tests, UART, OS timers, and more. This program saw action debugging customer-returned silicon, leading to manufacturing software screens. \n \nDesigned and implemented a C++ Windows XP DLL which programs FPGAs thru an embedded VHDL module. This piece of software is essentially driver code which configures multiple FPGAs simultaneously thru a number of different interfaces, including parallel port, PCI bridge, PLX device, JTAG, SelectMap, and a proprietary bus interface.

Systems Validation Engineer Intel January 2001  \u2013  December 2003  (3 years) Debugged a wide variety software failures on Intel random concurrency software. Failures included, improper test software setup, BIOS failures, and silicon logic bugs. Units debugged included interrupt controller, power management, LPC, LAN, CSA for gigabit ethernet, and system management. \n \nCoded an embedded DOS flash driver. In the process, this required reverse engineering a Windows driver to determine PCI configuration settings, developing a complex set of code to intermittently stop and resume operation while performing data reads and writes. Code was written in a combination of C and assembly. \n \nDeveloped a data pattern generation API in C for Linux-based concurrency test software. This API was nicknamed the \u201cmother of all pattern generators\u201d, and it gave users flexibility and performance.
