I've had a few: technologist, market and customer researcher, marketeer, startup wonk, teacher, Peace Corps volunteer. Pretty normal as compared to earlier generations where 30 years with the same company was the norm.  \n \nIn fact my career feels more like a freeway interchange than a path.  \n \nStepping back from the chaos, the passion (and humor) permeating throughout is a relentless need to learn something new every day, to help others learn something new, and to look straight at the big problems and say hello.  \n \nSome may look at my collection of paths as disadvantageous and lacking focus. Perhaps, unless you've lived it. The benefit is being better able to connect the dots. In fact one of my favorite infographics was on LI a while back: the difference between knowledge and experience, knowledge is a scattering of dots, experience is being able to connect the dots. \n \nI connect the dots. \n \nMaybe this sounds ludicrously wishy-washy. It's not. To be good at connecting dots, you need to understand not only markets (ie, how to make money) but also institutional culture, market culture and the socio-political-economic culture that permeates the landscape.  \n \nBut just connecting dots is not be enough. \n \nIt's one thing to sit back and pontificate about dots. I'd be pretty useless if I could not act on this to move the ball forward. This means getting my hands dirty identifying opportunities both strategic and tactical, opening doors, creating prototypes, building product and marketing collateral, websites and other social media stuff, surveys, and speaking at conferences.  \n \nThe result is a team player who cuts through the nonsense to get at a successful outcome, whatever we define as a successful outcome.
