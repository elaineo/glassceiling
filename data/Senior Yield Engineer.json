Molecules researched within the topic of interest include biomolecules like chromophore of Photoactive Yellow Protein (PYP), Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), and azobenzene. With gas-phase spectroscopy and jet-cooled molecular beam tecnique, highly-resolved energy levels and vibrational modes in the excited states can be recorded. They are probed by techniques known as the resonance enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI), hole burning, and depletion. Dynamics of 'dark state' can be probed with delayed ionization. Combined with computational studies, we uncover vast information on the dynamics of the molecules which include lifetime of excited states, vertical and adiabatic energy levels, modes and mechanism of photoisomerization, conformations, and influence of proteins on the dynamics and properties of the molecules. The University of Sheffield Master of Science (MSc),  Nanoelectronics and nanomechanics 2008  \u2013 2009 Designing and fabricating microcavity polariton electroluminiescence OLED. We investigated Forster energy transfer on a host-guest polymer that was used to develop the emissive layer of the OLED. At the same time designing a microcavity of which on one side an in-house grown indium tin oxide and on the other side capped with a highly reflective dielectric mirror (Distributed Bragg Reflector) constructed with plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Trapping the photon emitted by the emission layer, we precisely detuned the microcavity to induce strong coupling between photon and exciton within the microcavity. As the exciton and photon are in resonance, polariton (light-matter interaction) is generated and measurement of strong coupling can be inferred from a reflectivity spectra recorded at different detecting angles. Such coherence phenomena within a microcavity has potential application for polariton laser at room temperature.
