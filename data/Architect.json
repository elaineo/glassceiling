Innovations include the ProShare Build WebPage enabling some 20 SW teams to directly update their components in the ProShare build, the IntelSafeWEP library which greatly improved ProShare reliability on Windows 3.1 platforms, and complete redesign of the ProShare 3.0 installation program greatly reducing time to add new modules, enable localization, and also trimming disk space requirements by over 75%.  \n \nAddressBook Team Lead \u2013 Managed 4 person team while serving as the SW architect for the ProShare AddressBook infrastructure. Designed & implemented several shared components such as the Visual Business Card, General Type Manager class. and redesign of supporting database schema to increase performance and reduce application footprint. (4 patents)  \n ProShare - Software Team Lead Intel Corporation October 1995  \u2013  August 1998  (2 years 11 months) Work on several teams on the massive ProShare application suite.  \n \nProShare New Applications Team to interview diverse groups of ProShare Users to find new usages and applications. Then implemented the audio infrastructure for the GroupLink Groupware project. This application audio intercom support as well as automatic presence detection using voice and camera motion detection to let geologically dispersed teammates quickly get in touch. While not brought to market as a product, this application, essentially a pre-cursor of Microsoft Lync, was very popular during internal and external user tests and, as Lync has since.  \n \nApplication Sharing Team Architect \u2013 Designed framework to move Application Sharing to Resource Only Dll architecture (which was enventually adopted by the entire ProShare application suite).
