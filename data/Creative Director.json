I am an excellent manager and adept at motivating and guiding high-performing creative teams.  \n \nI started my career in print, but jumped to multimedia design in the mid '90s before rising through the ranks of various digital agencies to the position I hold today. Along the way I learned tons about marketing and strategy, built and managed several creative departments, led pitches that won over $40M in new business, and received honors and accolades from clients and the industry alike. \n \nI play many roles as an executive creative director: department leader, rainmaker, client advisor, storyteller, mentor, teacher, collaborator and juggler, to name a few.

Welcome to VITA Organic Foods (pronounced: vee-tuh). VITA, a 5-principle start up, began as an idea by (Jen Meister, a holistic nutritional counselor and her friend & restaurant chef Adele Flores) to bring the holistic lifestyle (living simple, clean and whole) to food.

Freelance CD, Writer Rokkan December 2014  \u2013  February 2015  (3 months) Greater New York City Area Digital brand relaunch: One&Only Resorts. \n \nIn a world of vacation spots and destinations, One&Only is legitimately otherworldly.

The result is beautiful work for a remarkable place whose ultimate experience cannot be found on a map.

Consulting Creative Director: Brand, Advt. & Integrated Marketing OppenheimerFunds February 2014  \u2013  June 2014  (5 months) nyc In 1960, America for all intent and purposes was the stocks\u2019 market. So when Leon Levy, one of the founders of OppenheimerFunds was asked about the firm investing globally he said, \"I was taking a different look a the familiar rather than adhering to conventional wisdom.\"  \n \nNearly 60 years later, that key critical insight has been the trademark belief behind the confident spirit of The Right Way To Invest. \n \nFor every brand, job No.1 is making certain foundational truths remain intact in every piece of content. And that\u2019s where I was brought in.  \n \nAs a Creative Director cum Strategist mining and shaping insights and ideas that reflect core truths and differences, Leon Levy\u2019s point of view struck a chord within me. If you\u2019re not fully realizing and using what makes you different, your brand and message concedes to sameness.  \n \nEngaged as a Content Strategist, I was looking for evidence of \u201cmission drift\u201d \u2013 when a brand goes off its well founded course - and evidence of disparate communications. Constructing and conducting a messaging audit to find the answers, I worked with Brand and Advertising Directors, Investment Services, PM\u2019s, SME\u2019s, Economists, Integrated Marketing, Distribution, Digital, Corporate Communications, Social Media and Editorial teams. The outcome led to the creation of a more declarative, impassioned narrative. \n \nFrom pitch books to thought leadership white papers, fund announcements to sales sheets, product launches to infographics, social media to article pages, blogs to site messaging, a more singular and definitive voice is a taking shape. And the brand\u2019s core strengths and differences are being better leveraged across distribution and syndication channels. \n \n \nBrand Communications, Product Messaging, Content Strategy & Development, Strategic Problem Solving, Creative Direction, Integrated Marketing, Technical Writing Freelance Group Creative Director - United Airlines, Tassimo- Mondelez mcgarrybowen November 2012  \u2013  June 2013  (8 months) new york city 150,000,000 million people fly United Airlines yearly. As the GCD on the brand, I put my miles in, learned the insights of the airline business and got a pretty great view of the competitive landscape on the ground and at 35,000 feet. With the long awaited development and launch of a new multi-channel brand campaign, as well as local and global messaging, I also spent over 100 hours in airports creating nine branded content films, including one for Team USA / 2014 Winter Olympics. \n \nTassimo - the greatest cup of coffee, espresso, cappuccino, mocha, latte, tea, cocoa, you've yet to have. global brand campaign development: multi-channel (viral, digital, print, ooh, tv) \n \nMaserati - Two words for a car whose history, appeal, power and beauty will never slow down:  \nItalian Mettle.

Site work led to print and digital elements furthering the story of how IBM is helping city leaders around world, change convention and embrace data an insights from analytics to make their cities smarter, faster.  \n \nOther IBM projects included:  \nThe writing and positioning of \"Tomorrow Ready\" a new brand platform for IBM Smarter Computing - as well as development of an APP.  \n \nAuthored \"The Patent Kings\" - 140,000 patents told by tweets. A viral project for IBM that took on a life on tumblr as \"20 Years of Innovation.\" \n \nBlackRock + BP Group Creative Director JWT October 2007  \u2013  June 2011  (3 years 9 months) Group lead on ROLEX. \nDiageo (Jose Cuervo, Smirnoff), HSBC, J+J (Zyrtec, LIsterine, Sudafed), Edge shave gel. \n \nWith seven years of creative leadership on ROLEX, I know the brand and every aspect of it (from brand lore to manufacturing to servicing to models to achievers to events/ sponsors, corporate communication) like the back of my hand or, should I say, wrist? With its iconic and worldwide recognition, ROLEX - privately held - is not about Cannes or the Effie, agency PR or, anything that could resemble \"Pomp & Circumstance.\" Perhaps the quietest advertising and marketing monster, ROLEX lives \"big\" elsewhere. The brand is about ideas, people, events, living history, and calibrated movements that live up to every point in their iconic 5-point crown - a perfect balance of enduring integrity, craftsmanship, purpose and design. Alive and kicking on the most global and competitive stages - where it is Man vs Himself vs History, ROLEX is not quiet. And neither is the work. \"A Crown For Every Achievement\" was my first campaign for ROLEX. The tagline remained for eight years until Live For Greatness appeared. Nearly a decade of global brand campaign work was a gift. I had the opportunity to create, think, write, design, collaborate and execute. And along the way, I worked with some the world's greatest names in sport, art, culture, design and exploration and on the toughest of proving grounds. ROLEX is more than a timepiece, or a \"luxury\" good. The reason \"why?\" Because in truth, a ROLEX isn't bought, it's earned. \n \nMultichannel brand communications.

Observations of human expression when immersed in expressive AR prosthesis systems. \n \nMy research investigates and documents future concepts in digital media technology and the use of Natural User Interfaces (NUI) in expressive ways for connecting humans virtually to their more natural/traditional creative techniques. At the intersection of technology and human experience a new language is being formed that enables people to create with unlimited scope and expression. NUI technology such as pressure sensitive pen/tablets, multi-touch surfaces, augmented reality eyewear, virtual reality headsets, acoustic fingerprinting, haptic feedback, 3D/4D printing and sensor-based biometrics, etc, act as a prosthesis for the skills of the user/artist, bridging gaps between deep specialised learnt skills from traditional media types such as painting, drawing, sculpting, etc. \n \nBuilding on my past studio practice (30 years), recognised digital media industry publication The Art of Making Marks, current research including 100+ expert interviews posted at http://www.viddler.com/channel/artofwa, blog posts at www.artofwa.com, daily technology discoveries posted at au.linkedin.com/in/richolland/, it is the aim of this thesis to focus future research activities on building AR/NUI installations that utilise prototypes and experimental NUI systems supplied by industry advisors and sponsors gained over the past 12 months for qualitative observation of human expression when immersed in said creative prosthesis systems.  \n \nAcademic Supervisors - Dr Phillip George, Prof Ross Harley UNSW \nChief Industry Supervisor - Masahiko Yamada (CEO) \u2013 Wacom \n \nIndustry Advisors - Russell Brown - Adobe, Bill Buxton - Microsoft, Duncan Brinsmead - Autodesk, John Derry - Painter, Uwe Maurer - ArtRage, Tom Misner - Studios 301, Larry Weinberg - Smith Micro, Ron Cobb - Futurist, Syd Mead - Futurist.
