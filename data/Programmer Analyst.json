In conclusion I would thoroughly recommend Ian as a speaker and would welcome him back to talk to our girls in the future.\u201d Caroline Bennett, ICT Teacher, Luckley-Oakfield School Most Influential Thought Leader on Linkedin Social Media Directors December 2012 Social Media Directors Gives 2 awards to Workbooks Ian Moyse in Social Media Christmas Competition 2012  \n \nhttp://www.socialmediadirectors.co.uk/our-social-media-christmas-competition-2012-award-winners/ \n \nBest LinkedIn Group : Channel & Account Management Experts  \nMost Influential Business Person \u201cThought Leader\u201d on LinkedIn : Ian Moyse Most Influential Thought Leader on Linkedin Social Media Directors December 2012 Social Media Directors Gives 2 awards to Workbooks Ian Moyse in Social Media Christmas Competition 2012  \n \nhttp://www.socialmediadirectors.co.uk/our-social-media-christmas-competition-2012-award-winners/ \n \nBest LinkedIn Group : Channel & Account Management Experts  \nMost Influential Business Person \u201cThought Leader\u201d on LinkedIn : Ian Moyse Most Influential Thought Leader on Linkedin Social Media Directors December 2012 Social Media Directors Gives 2 awards to Workbooks Ian Moyse in Social Media Christmas Competition 2012  \n \nhttp://www.socialmediadirectors.co.uk/our-social-media-christmas-competition-2012-award-winners/ \n \nBest LinkedIn Group : Channel & Account Management Experts  \nMost Influential Business Person \u201cThought Leader\u201d on LinkedIn : Ian Moyse Appointed 2013 Executive Council (EC) member for the CompTIA UK Channel Community (UKCC) CompTIA (January 2013 - March 2015) January 2013 CompTIA, the global, non-profit trade association for the IT industry, appointed Moyse to its 2013 Executive Council (EC) for the CompTIA UK Channel Community (UKCC) alongside a select number of other industry channel leaders. \n \nhttp://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/news/2237488/magnificent-seven-join-comptia-group \n \nThe CompTIA community is a group of leading IT vendors, distributors and solution providers who work together to facilitate networking, learning and industry change within the channel segment of the IT industry.
