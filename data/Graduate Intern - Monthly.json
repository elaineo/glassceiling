I reached out to learn more when I heard that a team of Duke Alumni was developing a device to track when people take their drugs and partner with their doctors to encourage compliance through smart reminders. I have since helped them build their software and soon I will be working with care providers to learn about their feedback as we pilot the service.

Google Student Ambassador at Duke University Google August 2013  \u2013  May 2014  (10 months) Durham, NC With my experience as an intern at Google and being a finalist in the 2011 Google Science Fair, it was an easy decision to apply to become a Google Student Ambassador on campus. I had learned about so many free services for research and collaboration while at Google, and I was happy to let people know that they were available and demonstrate their usefulness. I was also very excited to get to try out Google Glass and let others at Duke University try it for themselves. It came in handy when I was on crutches for three months to be able to communicate hands-free. I could see similar technology being very helpful to the disabled community. Undergraduate Lab Assistant in the Nicolelis Lab Duke University April 2012  \u2013  October 2013  (1 year 7 months) Duke University I have been trained to work directly with Macaques in the Duke Vivarium. As a lab, we work on developing Brain Computer Interfaces for direct neural control of robotics as well as neural feedback. I help run tests and help program the tests. Software Engineering Intern on the Hangouts API Team Google January 2013  \u2013  August 2013  (8 months) Kirkland, WA I began programming in high school and have found that it is both something I am quite good at and useful in many areas of my life. I admire Google\u2019s focus on empowering the world with knowledge, and how active their employees are in their communities. After a tough interview process, I worked as an intern on the Google Hangouts team in Kirkland, WA, and learned a lot over the course of last summer. I took the idea of making it easier to help others in live video conversations and turned it into a full feature largely on my own which was released by the end of summer as \"Control Room\". I worked with Al Jazeera and the Huffington Post to test it, received a peer bonus, and had a glowing exit interview. Engineering Intern in the Core Technologies Division Medtronic June 2011  \u2013  August 2011  (3 months) Minneapolis, MN At the Medtronic World Headquarters, I worked on a variety of projects. I designed, 3D modeled, and then used a material testing apparatus for hyper elastic metal wires. I designed and implemented a testing protocol for synchronized high speed image capture and tensile testing and wrote code to analyze large sets of image files. The image analysis code implemented both blob and edge detection to track marks. I also prepared and tested the material properties of animal heart valve tissue before and after thawing.

The tech industry is hard to pin down and I'm still trying to figure out where I fit into it. Although I'm focusing in on neuroengineering in the immediate future my background is all over the place and includes semiconductors, control systems, and RF and digital hardware. If you're interested in some of these things, we should chat! Please don't hesitate to get in touch with me.
