Watson Research Center Yorktown Heights, New York Lead Firmware Architect for IBM Power Edge of Network Processor. This processor was wire-speed System-on-a-chip with 16 Power Architecture Cores ( 64 threads ) and various accelerators.  \nAround this chip we build a full platform starting from chip, system board, firmware, operating system all the way to the software stack. As Lead Firmware architect I was responsible for concept and implementation of boot and operational firmware for this board. Further description in \"Design and Implementation of a Network Centric Appliance Platform\".  \nBeside the firmware theme I was in the project the expert for PCI Express. I was involved starting from signal and protocol level, firmware on the PCI Express endpoint, firmware on PCI Express host, Linux device driver up to developing novel concepts of exploiting DMA, MMIO and IOMMU for user space exploitation. Lead Firmware Architect IBM 2004  \u2013  2008  (4 years) Boeblingen For being able to boot Linux on PPC970 processor without a Hypervisor I was part of a small team to create a OpenSource Open Firmware compliant Firmware stack called \"SLOF\" (Slimline Open Firmware ). This code was released and could be used for JS20/JS21 Power based blades to replace the original hypervisor based Firmware and give the HPC computing the ability to experience the full speed of the hardware.  \nWhen IBM decided to build products based on the CELL Broadband Engine ( Processor developed primarily for PS3 with Sony and Toshiba ) SLOF was chosen to be the initialization and boot firmware. For this projects I had the role as lead firmware architect and as such not only ensure the architecture to be modular and adaptable for the different platforms but also enhance the functionality and features of the stack. The biggest challenge was the RoadRunner project which was based on a hybrid architecture of AMD and CELL B.E. with filled 296 Racks. Booting this system required stability and implementing of challenging concepts like MTFTP.  \nIBM Roadrunner was on top spot of TOP500 list from 2008-2009.

Beside the compiler I worked on the initial memory management of zLinux, the low level entry code (entry.S ), provided the first zVM specific block device and general bringup of the kernel. Immediately after the release of the code on December 1999 we started working on the 64bit port, which involved defining a new ABI, adding new 64 bit instruction to the compiler and adaption of low level routines in the Linux kernel. Work also involved interaction with Open Source developer as maintainer of GCC s390 backend.

I am responsible for performance characterization and analysis of suboptimal performance. When I joined the team performance was primarily a measurement exercise. I introduced a rigorous methodology of characterizing where time is spent and then performing analysis to determine where improvements could be made. I advocated the use of tools such as perf and oprofile for CPU utilization analysis and introduced the team to the perf trace tools for analysis of scheduler behavior, lock contention, and disk io bottlenecks. Senior Technical Staff Member IBM January 2010  \u2013  December 2013  (4 years) BladeCenter Networking Infrastructure Development. In this position I was responsible for leading a globally distributed team to design and implement storage networking infrastructure. This was an extremely complex assignment spanning multiple domains. Those included switching ASIC programming, ASIC simulation, network administration technologies, virtualization, and approved and emerging networking standards. I have contributed to the development of storage networking standards and am a named inventor on issued patents in this domain. Senior Technical Staff Member IBM May 2005  \u2013  December 2009  (4 years 8 months) Performance Analyst. In this position I was responsible for system performance analysis and improvement on Power systems and attached storage subsystems. This required in depth knowledge of Power processor architecture, cache coherence mechanisms, address translation mechanisms, and their effects on CPU performance. I also worked on operating system performance design for NUMA architictures and am named on US patents relevant to that technology. \n \nI also acquired expertise in storage subsystems performance in multiple domains including the use of write cache in RAID adapters, command ordering in rotational disk drives, and solid state drives. I evaluated, diagnosed problems, and developed solutions for optimizing performance using hybrid storage subsystems employing rotational and solid state drives. \n \nI performed overall system performance analysis on virtualized environments in a development environment. I also worked with customers to develop solutions and diagnosed critical performance problems in existing installations. My work required interactions with co-workers all over the United States and clients from all over the world.

My duties also included bringup of prototype server hardware from power on to the operating system command prompt and then running workloads to validate the functionality of the system. \n \nThe latter required a 'shake it until it breaks and then diagnose the problem' mentality. The problems I diagnosed ranged from logic errors in prototype silicon to bugs in operating system code. I worked with development organizations across the United States to diagnose, temporarily circumvent, and permanently fix problems in every area of the system. Staff Engineer IBM May 1986  \u2013  April 1992  (6 years) Operating system development \nI was responsible for serviceability components. In this role I developed and maintained interfaces that allowed device management code; e.g., tape, disk, networking, to report errors to the system administrator.
