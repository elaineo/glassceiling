I have taken ownership of the section and as such I have been able to flourish professionally. Technical Pre-Sales IBM October 2011  \u2013  December 2012  (1 year 3 months) I worked in Technical Pre-Sales for IBM Collaboration Systems which has given me experience in a dynamic and demanding sales role. To utilise my previous experience with data capture and management, and collaborative working I took an interest in IBM Connections and IBM Forms Experience Builder (FEB). I attended a number of client meetings giving me the opportunity to explore their requirements and look to how IBM can add value. I worked on the different stages of the technical sales process and gained experience of replying to RFPs, working through PoTs and developing PoCs. I organised an FEB training day for IBM business partners; as the software was new I created my own training materials and presented and demonstrated the software capabilities at the event. This role proved to be a good experience and gave me an awareness of IBM sales. Collaborative Working Capability Exploitation UK Ministry of Defence January 2007  \u2013  October 2011  (4 years 10 months) I started here by developing and maintaining web applications. \nI was then promoted into the role of Collaborative Working Capability Exploitation which allowed me to expand on the skills and knowledge I'd already begun to develop. Project managing the pilot roll out of the collaborative working tool provided me with an exciting and challenging opportunity. The project determined the go/no-go decision for rolling out the software throughout the wider MoD so as well as being high pressure it was also high profile, with a tight deadline to meet. \nFollowing the successful pilot a project to roll out the software to other units was established. At this point myself and my team were responsible for enabling the end users to effectively exploit the new tool. As well as introducing the technological change the greatest challenge was the cultural change. It was important to find the unique selling point for each individual unit to enable them to see the value in the new tool and to embrace the change. I focused on process improvement to set best practices and standardised routine tasks with the overall aim to improve efficiency. I had a particular interest in the storage and consequent use of data, making data capture methods simple and providing reporting methods suitable to meet the requirements of the organisation. I developed and maintained a library of best practice examples, will full instructions on how to implement the solutions.

I take the events through to fruition and work hard to generate an audience. Planning and organisation is an integral part of this role, my diligence with this has improved the management of the information, and allows the team to work collaboratively to ensure all components are complete and the information is easily accessible. Managing a budget is a new experience for me, again effective planning has assisted me with this by ensuring I have sufficient funds to cover costs, whilst maintaining a record of expenditure to comply with audit regulations. \nI took complete ownership of our exhibitor stand at a recent event and created a \u201cPop-Up\u201d Innovation Centre as well as arranging round table sessions. Feedback highlighted the success of both components, my conscientiousness and attention to detail resulted in smooth running on the day and gave a positive experience for the partners. Along with the logistics of the stand I also designed and produced the marketing collateral used on the day and to advertise the event. \nI am the team leader for two interns who manage the day-to-day operations of the IIC which involves an average of 25 business partner and client meetings per week. I ensure they have the opportunities to work in the areas of interest to them whilst still ensuring the objectives of the team are met. I have taken ownership of the section and as such I have been able to flourish professionally. Technical Pre-Sales IBM October 2011  \u2013  December 2012  (1 year 3 months) I worked in Technical Pre-Sales for IBM Collaboration Systems which has given me experience in a dynamic and demanding sales role. To utilise my previous experience with data capture and management, and collaborative working I took an interest in IBM Connections and IBM Forms Experience Builder (FEB). I attended a number of client meetings giving me the opportunity to explore their requirements and look to how IBM can add value. I worked on the different stages of the technical sales process and gained experience of replying to RFPs, working through PoTs and developing PoCs. I organised an FEB training day for IBM business partners; as the software was new I created my own training materials and presented and demonstrated the software capabilities at the event. This role proved to be a good experience and gave me an awareness of IBM sales.

Collaborative Working Capability Exploitation UK Ministry of Defence January 2007  \u2013  October 2011  (4 years 10 months) I started here by developing and maintaining web applications. \nI was then promoted into the role of Collaborative Working Capability Exploitation which allowed me to expand on the skills and knowledge I'd already begun to develop. Project managing the pilot roll out of the collaborative working tool provided me with an exciting and challenging opportunity. The project determined the go/no-go decision for rolling out the software throughout the wider MoD so as well as being high pressure it was also high profile, with a tight deadline to meet. \nFollowing the successful pilot a project to roll out the software to other units was established. At this point myself and my team were responsible for enabling the end users to effectively exploit the new tool. As well as introducing the technological change the greatest challenge was the cultural change. It was important to find the unique selling point for each individual unit to enable them to see the value in the new tool and to embrace the change. I focused on process improvement to set best practices and standardised routine tasks with the overall aim to improve efficiency. I had a particular interest in the storage and consequent use of data, making data capture methods simple and providing reporting methods suitable to meet the requirements of the organisation. I developed and maintained a library of best practice examples, will full instructions on how to implement the solutions.
