Throughout my five years of experience as an infantry commander, I grew as a strategic problem-solver who cultivates culture, motivation, and pride. This led to autonomy and team success during training and while on deployment. As an MBA student, I had the opportunity to work on projects with very diverse groups. Through building strong relationships, collaboration, and respect with domestic and international students alike, I was elected as president of the Multicultural MBA Association. During my internship, I led the engineering and facilities department comprised of nine members with an average tenure of 27 years. Together, we kept a 1.5 million square foot distribution center at the highest level of service throughout the ten weeks of my internship. These successes would not have been possible without constant emphasis on collaboration, team focus, and a performance driven culture. \n \nAs someone who embraces challenges and readily takes on ambiguous tasks, I have always relied on my problem-solving and leadership skills to overcome obstacles and pursue opportunities. These opportunities include building teams, taking on new projects, and developing an action plan with milestones and defining what success looks like.

These successes would not have been possible without constant emphasis on collaboration, team focus, and a performance driven culture. \n \nAs someone who embraces challenges and readily takes on ambiguous tasks, I have always relied on my problem-solving and leadership skills to overcome obstacles and pursue opportunities. These opportunities include building teams, taking on new projects, and developing an action plan with milestones and defining what success looks like. I welcome the opportunity to further discuss my skills and qualifications in project management, supply chain, or business development. Through serving as a Marine Corps Infantry Commander in Iraq and Afghanistan, managing multiple market strategy and supply chain projects, and having had a rigorous academic background, I have gained valuable insights, skills, and experiences. \n \nAs a military leader, MBA student, and summer intern I persistently recognize team members as the source of success, collaborate with diverse groups, and maintain a performance-driven culture. Throughout my five years of experience as an infantry commander, I grew as a strategic problem-solver who cultivates culture, motivation, and pride. This led to autonomy and team success during training and while on deployment. As an MBA student, I had the opportunity to work on projects with very diverse groups. Through building strong relationships, collaboration, and respect with domestic and international students alike, I was elected as president of the Multicultural MBA Association. During my internship, I led the engineering and facilities department comprised of nine members with an average tenure of 27 years. Together, we kept a 1.5 million square foot distribution center at the highest level of service throughout the ten weeks of my internship. These successes would not have been possible without constant emphasis on collaboration, team focus, and a performance driven culture. \n \nAs someone who embraces challenges and readily takes on ambiguous tasks, I have always relied on my problem-solving and leadership skills to overcome obstacles and pursue opportunities.
