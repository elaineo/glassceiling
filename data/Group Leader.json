I lead a team of data analysis and data visualization engineers working to maintain and improve yield, cost, and velocity. I also lead cross-functional teams to solve complex technical problems to deliver results for the business. We use complex data analysis, statistics, and LEAN manufacturing principles to drive continuous improvement.  \n \nI received my PhD in Chemical Engineering in 2008 from The Ohio State University. My graduate research involved the study of structure/property relations and optimization of semiconducting polymers for detection of ionizing radiation. \n \nMy strengths are in leadership, communication, mediation, collaboration, and problem solving, as demonstrated in work history. My leadership skills are shown in my steady, even-keeled nature, which allows me to effectively manage high pressure situations with large groups in cross-functional areas and get the best results.  \n \nSpecialties: People and project management, technical problem solving, multidisciplinary project development and integrated problem solving, semiconductor processing and fabrication, polymer microfabrication and processing, conjugated polymers and small molecules, nanoparticles, radiation detection, materials structure/property relations Summary I currently work at Intel Corporation as an Engineering Manager in the Yield department for high volume semiconductor manufacturing.
