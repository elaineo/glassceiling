The Ph.D. dissertation demonstrates that the study of cognitive and symbolic aspects of weather and climate is as important as the study of responses to specific weather events or conditions. What people know about weather and climate conditions (the categorical knowledge that help them describe weather and climate) and what people feel (the knowledge based on senses and moral order that help people comprehend weather and climate) both evoke strong responses. Moreover, values and beliefs about spirituality, nature, morality, work, sociality, and responsibility, linked to experience-based ecological and economic knowledge, appear to be the main ingredients in people's responses to any type of crises. Knowledge, perceptions and responses to crises then, are inseparable domains; and the understanding of one should include the analysis of the others.
