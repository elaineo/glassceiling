View Graduate Research Associate Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of North Texas August 2010  \u2013  May 2014  (3 years 10 months) My area of interest is understanding laser material interactions with an emphasis on crystallization of amorphous precursors and synthesis of amorphous coatings. \n \nThe study on crystallization behavior of amorphous materials involved understanding the underlying physics behind laser material interaction and its effects on phase transformation from amorphous to crystalline state. A microstructure-property-processing correlation is established in order to synthesize novel magnetic materials. The effects of laser material interaction are assessed by extensive characterization using analytical tools including DSC,XRD,SEM, TEM and Atom Probe Tomography. On the basis of microstructure-processing co-relationship, the laser processing parameters are optimized to enhance the magnetic property of the crystallized material. \n \nSynthesizing Fe-based bulk amorphous coatings on structural steels for extreme environments involves synthesizing bulk amorphous coatings by choosing appropriate laser parameters to obtain a sound coating with desired microstructure. Laser processing experiments are designed and performed keeping in view of various aspects like dilution ratio from the substrate, thermal histories and cooling rates, atmospheric effects like oxidation, contamination and also re-heating effects. Efficient ways of heat transfer are also designed depending on the requirement.The synthesized coatings are tested for corrosion and wear resistance. The tested samples are further analyzed using analytical tools like XRD,SEM, TEM and Atom Probe Tomography in order to understand the mechanisms operating during corrosion and wear.  \n \nI also work on COMSOL modelling to evaluate the thermal histories experience during processing and validate the results using experimental observations (Open) 1 organization Materials Advantage UNT Chapter View (Open) 4 honors and awards Invited Member of Phi Kappa Phi View 4th position in Inter-university North Texas Student Symposium View Tolhouse Graduate School Travel Grant View Tolhouse Graduate School Travel Grant View (Open) 10 courses Advanced Physical Metalurgy Thermodynamics of Materials Bonding Structure and Crystallography Mechanical Behavior of Materials Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Properties of Materials Phase Transformations in Materials Compound Semiconductors Applied Fracture Mechanics SEM and FIB Transmission Electron Microscopy See more (Open) 1 recommendation Junyeon Hwang Senior Researcher at Korea Institute of Science and Technology Shravan is very sincere and self motivated not only for his work but also his life.
