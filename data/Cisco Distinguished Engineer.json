He specializes in protocol design at the Internet, transport, and application layers. Dan is currently involved in projects related to DDoS, threat defense, providing user-visible benefits to IPv6, SDN flow communication from hosts to network elements, and mobile optimization.  \n \nDan co-chaired the IETF BEHAVE working group from 2006-2013, which created NAT64 and NAT44 standards. He has authored or co-authored over 20 RFCs related to voice security, IPv6, and NAT, including Security Descriptions (RFC4568) which is currently the most widely deployed mechanism for keying SRTP. To improve SRTP keying, he co-chaired two RTPSEC meetings which resulted in DTLS-SRTP being chosen as the replacement. He is working on enhancing DTLS-SRTP for group keying (EKT). To improve user experiences with IPv6 dual-stack deployments he co-authored Happy Eyeballs (RFC6555), which is now implemented in OS X, Firefox, and Chrome. His technical contributions on NAT and firewall traversal include co-authoring STUN and editing and co-authoring Port Control Protocol (PCP). Earlier he co-authored Fax Simple Mode (RFC2305, also known as T.37). He occasionally contributes to Internet Protocol Journal, IETF Journal, and IEEE Internet Computing.  \n \nEditor of Port Control Protocol (PCP, RFC6887), an IETF standard to create mappings in IPv6 and IPv4 firewalls, residential NATs, and carrier-grade NATs. PCP is deployed in iOS 7, OS X, and several commercial large-scale NATs. \n \nOver 30 patents issued related to encryption, voice security, firewall traversal, and network performance. \n \nTechnical specialties: IPv6/IPv4 transition: CGN, NAT44, NAT64, DNS64, 6rd, Dual-Stack Lite, VoIP security, SRTP, DTLS-SRTP, ZRTP.
