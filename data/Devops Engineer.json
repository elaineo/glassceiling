July 2013  \u2013 Present (2 years 1 month) Seattle, WA Part-time devops/systems engineering contracting at: Aucolla, Inc. and ActX, Inc. (Aucolla is the parent company of ActX). \n \nI won't say too much as I am under NDA, but work has primarily involved AWS, Chef, web servers, and managing database servers and replication. I've set up monitoring and logging systems, ensured the integrity and redundancy of backups, configured VPN servers, and more. Being under HIPAA, security of the site has been of paramount concern, including encryption at rest. \n \nI wrote a Ruby on Rails app to make deployment easy, interfacing with Chef and AWS. \n \nI've written documentation and trained a couple of junior system administrators on how to use Chef, and on the care and feeding of the systems. \n \nI've helped out on office systems, filling in on occasion for Windows administration and on-boarding staff, and configuring internal Xen systems and other office devices. \n \nI have also updated and managed several unrelated Drupal web servers for the parent company, Aucolla.com. \n Systems Administrator Windermere Solutions October 2012  \u2013  July 2013  (10 months) Seattle, WA Contracting at Windermere Solutions LLC \n- through Robert Half Technology (October 2012-February 2013) \n- direct contracting through my consulting org, TLA Technical Consulting (February 2013-July 2013) \n \nI primarily worked on restructuring DNS for Windermere Solutions, who host DNS for thousands of Windermere agent domains. I cleaned up DNS records on the existing DNS servers -- Solaris and Windows AD -- making DNS records consistent and complete, pruning old records, and sorting out who was authoritative for which zones with appropriate slave relationships, rather than both systems being authoritative. \n \nI migrated the primary DNS server from an old version of Bind on Solaris, which was EOLed, to a newer Bind on Ubuntu, without downtime. The new DNS configs were all done using Chef, using a data bag to distribute zone info. In addition, I set up slave DNS servers in AWS on the east and west coasts to avoid a SPOF of having their DNS servers in one datacenter, and configured firewalls appropriately to allow slave communication. I retired an additional BSD nameserver that served as an internal nameserver, and merged its functionality into the primary nameserver. I wrote scripts which allowed internal staff to easily manage customer DNS, using a combination of bash, ruby, git, bind commands and Chef. \n \nOther systems I worked or supported included:  \n- Apache (upgrading, and moving some web servers from Solaris to Ubuntu) \n- Nginx web servers \n- Java apps on Solaris \n- F5 load balancer \n- managing Ubuntu servers (on kvm/AWS) and Solaris servers running in Solaris Zones \n- VMWare \n- Migrating a lot of data from Sun storage systems to NetApp servers, with minimal impact to apps \n- Nagios/iCinga/Zabbix monitoring (including writing a Nagios plugin) \n- NTP \n- mail server configuration \n- Other Chef work \n \nI served on the on-call rotation for the Solaris, Ubuntu and Windows systems, and mentored junior system administrators. \n Site Reliability Engineer Google, Inc. June 2005  \u2013  July 2010  (5 years 2 months) Greater Seattle Area, WA I worked in Mountain View, CA from Jun-Aug 2005, then in the Kirkland & Seattle offices. \n \nInitially I was on the Oracle Calendar team, managing all aspects of the systems. We engineered a set of worldwide calendar servers to work way beyond their design, supporting internal calendaring for all employees - involving very careful tuning and scripting to allow replication between servers to succeed. \n \nWe then migrated all Oracle Calendar data to Google Calendar, within 3 months. This our small team achieved by the deadline, earning the #1 engineering achievement award at Google for the quarter. The actual migration was in parallel over a weekend. My work included determining the needs of internal customers, figuring out the translation of data from Oracle to Google Calendar, managing the project part of the time, and writing many of the scripts for the migration. \n \nAfter migration, we developed tools to manage corp Google Calendar data in Ruby, and did all the escalated user support and resource management for internal Calendar. I was the last person left in the team, the sole escalated support for around 30,000 employees for Google Calendar, interfacing with the dev team and resolving more tickets combined than the entire internal sysops team. I won an award for best documentation in the sysops group for the docs I wrote for Google Calendar, and handed my job over to ~500 people, so that I would not be a SPOF. \n \nI then moved to the internal Storage team. We managed ~180 NetApp servers, taking replication to a new level beyond any other NetApp customers, with tiered worldwide replication layers. One project I did was determining owners for all the data we managed, and contacting owners to find out their preferred alerting method, then set up disk space alerts to the owners using those (many) methods. This saved our small team many sleepless nights! \n \nI was in the on-call rotation for all internal services initially, then for Calendar and Storage systems respectively. \n Senior Unix System Administrator/Senior Systems Engineer Amazon.com October 1998  \u2013  March 2003  (4 years 6 months) Seattle, WA As a senior system administrator, I initially worked with multiple teams, as needed.  \n \nOne of the first things I did was manually build Amazon's webserver #13 from a CD :). One of my first achievements after that was creating a remote install setup for RIS under Digital UNIX within 3 days, despite being told not to do it, and that it didn't work. Not only did I make it work; I also got it to patch and reboot systems, and wrote scripts to automatically post-configure them. This saved the entire team of 20 people a lot of time, as before that it took most of a day and bussing to the data center with a CD to install a server. Afterwards, we could do remote installs in parallel, each taking only a few unattended hours to complete. \n \nI then was assigned to the website team, and was on call for the primary Amazon website, determining which team was responsible for any outages, and fixing the issue if it was our team's reponsibility. I built out the initial Auctions/Marketsite servers on Digital UNIX, in a few hours, using my RIS install. I was later on a small team that got special recognition from Jeff Bezos for migrating the website to Red Hat Linux, within 3 months. I owned several parts of the website during the years I was on the team, including images and cache servers. In one case when the Build team did not have time to set up deployment for a service we needed to provide on the website, I figured out the Perl scripts the Build team used, and rolled my own deployment. This script stayed stable for the entire time it was in operation, vs the main website deployment which broke frequently. \n \nAfter that I moved to the internal systems engineering group. My primary responsibility was NetApp servers, and later NetBackup, but I was also on-call for all internal services -- DNS, LDAP, calendar systems, mail systems, and more. \n Computer Systems Manager University of Cape Town June 1991  \u2013  February 1998  (6 years 9 months) Analyst/Programmer Woolworths November 1990  \u2013  May 1991  (7 months) Cape Town Area, South Africa Spec, design and programming in Informix 4GL of a financial system.

This script stayed stable for the entire time it was in operation, vs the main website deployment which broke frequently. \n \nAfter that I moved to the internal systems engineering group. My primary responsibility was NetApp servers, and later NetBackup, but I was also on-call for all internal services -- DNS, LDAP, calendar systems, mail systems, and more. \n Computer Systems Manager University of Cape Town June 1991  \u2013  February 1998  (6 years 9 months) Computer Systems Manager University of Cape Town June 1991  \u2013  February 1998  (6 years 9 months) Analyst/Programmer Woolworths November 1990  \u2013  May 1991  (7 months) Cape Town Area, South Africa Spec, design and programming in Informix 4GL of a financial system.

DevOps Engineer Apmasphere November 2013  \u2013  June 2014  (8 months) As a DevOps engineer, I am responsible for the company\u2019s infrastructure on which the application and all the supporting tools are run. The infrastructure is run on Google Compute Engine and partially on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The product itself is run on Google App Engine and Google Compute Engine.  \n \nI am also accountable for integrating external resources into the business\u2019 development process, from a technical and security point of view (eg. making sure access is given to the necessary part of the code). I am also accountable for making sure that other developers\u2019 and contractors\u2019 deliverables can be integrated with our build and release process. Risk analysis and identifying potential issues (technical, security or workflow) that might come up when implementing a feature is part of my daily work. My daily routine also includes mentoring other team members, driving a consistent and efficient development process and aligning it with the company\u2019s methodologies as well as finding ways to improve it by following latest market trends in the industry. I regularly look for ways to enhance the infrastructure and to make it more efficient as well as sustainable. \n \nThis position is both rewarding and challenging. It enables me to highlight problems that show up later in the product lifecycle but are not visible immediately during development phase. At the same time, it gives me better understanding how the product is used by our customers and insight into the actual business cost of running the product. From these insights, I have the opportunity to reason about better approaches to improve the application in terms of performance and overall cost. Software Engineer Team Lead Apmasphere June 2013  \u2013  June 2014  (1 year 1 month) As a team lead, I was in responsible for driving the development of product components throughout all phases of the product development lifecycle. Our development process followed principles from agile methodologies. \n \nThis role allowed me to apply the knowledge that I acquired when working at Ericsson whilst working within a different setting and team dynamic. The most challenging and rewarding part of this role was working daily with an array of stakeholders such as product managers, business analysts and operations engineers, to set the right targets that aligned with the business\u2019 goals and were achievable given available resources (time, people and money).  \n \nDue to my team\u2019s thorough work during the planning and designing phases, code reviews and established automated testing procedures, the number of issues that appeared later testing phases and production was minimal. I acquired lots of hands-on experience and, most importantly, managed to complete all my deliverables that I was accountable for ahead of schedule with very little issues. Software Engineer Apmasphere August 2011  \u2013  June 2014  (2 years 11 months) As a software engineer, I worked on numerous software development problems within the world of web applications. I had an opportunity work with the latest technologies (AppEngine, NoSQL, HTML5, CSS3, JQuery). During my everyday work, I was exposed to the latest trends in software development industry like continuous integration, continuous deployment and continuous delivery. \n \nMy work required a lot of communication with other team members and other departments (i.e. product department, release department). The company implemented agile development principles which required me to efficiently communicate my designs as well as document and, if applicable, test them. I had an opportunity to be involved in areas ranging all the way from project scoping through development to the release and deployment. This environment also gave me an opportunity to use and apply knowledge from the system design and system architecture perspective. At the same time, this gave me a great opportunity to learn from my other team members. While working here I was encouraged to come up with my own solutions to problems and use modern algorithms, data structures (i.e. bloom filters) and tools.  \n \nWorking with different teams gave me a broader view of the end-product\u2019s constraints and requirements, gave me insight how that impacted the development cycle and how the mechanics of a product\u2019s requirements and technology came together to deliver true business value. Working with other departments, especially the product department and release department, gave me true insight as to the importance of defined analytics so that the usefulness and success of deployed features can be tracked. \n \nOn the server side aspect of the application, we used Google AppEngine. This infrastructure required me to deal with a unique set of problems specific to highly scalable and distributed systems.  \n \nOn the client side we used GWT and JavaScript in combination with the latest HTML5 features (i.e. IndexedDB).

I worked on numerous tasks, both on server side and client side (Browser, Javascript, Ajax, HTML). On the server side things ranged from low level C programming (Windows CE, Linux), network diagnostics (Wireshark, tcpdump), Java programming, JVM debugging, analysing performance (JUnit, Wireshark) and tests automation (JUnit/TestNG). On the client side I worked with HTML, Javascript, GWT and HTML5. I also contributed some code to the GWT project (a list of the issues I worked on can be found here http://gwt-code-reviews.appspot.com/user/markovuksanovic ). \n \nAs part of the project, I implemented a software architecture called Event Bus, which is nowadays a commonly used in GWT web application, and in some form on web applications in general. The architecture received ETK\u2019s internal innovation award for the architecture and was implemented later into the e-health product. \n \nDuring year 2010 Summer Camp in Ericsson I was one of mentors to a group of students who had to implement presentation of medical measurements in HTML5 Canvas element.

Software Engineer Team Lead Apmasphere June 2013  \u2013  June 2014  (1 year 1 month) As a team lead, I was in responsible for driving the development of product components throughout all phases of the product development lifecycle.

Software Engineer Apmasphere August 2011  \u2013  June 2014  (2 years 11 months) As a software engineer, I worked on numerous software development problems within the world of web applications. I had an opportunity work with the latest technologies (AppEngine, NoSQL, HTML5, CSS3, JQuery). During my everyday work, I was exposed to the latest trends in software development industry like continuous integration, continuous deployment and continuous delivery. \n \nMy work required a lot of communication with other team members and other departments (i.e. product department, release department). The company implemented agile development principles which required me to efficiently communicate my designs as well as document and, if applicable, test them. I had an opportunity to be involved in areas ranging all the way from project scoping through development to the release and deployment. This environment also gave me an opportunity to use and apply knowledge from the system design and system architecture perspective. At the same time, this gave me a great opportunity to learn from my other team members. While working here I was encouraged to come up with my own solutions to problems and use modern algorithms, data structures (i.e. bloom filters) and tools.  \n \nWorking with different teams gave me a broader view of the end-product\u2019s constraints and requirements, gave me insight how that impacted the development cycle and how the mechanics of a product\u2019s requirements and technology came together to deliver true business value. Working with other departments, especially the product department and release department, gave me true insight as to the importance of defined analytics so that the usefulness and success of deployed features can be tracked. \n \nOn the server side aspect of the application, we used Google AppEngine. This infrastructure required me to deal with a unique set of problems specific to highly scalable and distributed systems.  \n \nOn the client side we used GWT and JavaScript in combination with the latest HTML5 features (i.e. IndexedDB).

I worked on numerous tasks, both on server side and client side (Browser, Javascript, Ajax, HTML). On the server side things ranged from low level C programming (Windows CE, Linux), network diagnostics (Wireshark, tcpdump), Java programming, JVM debugging, analysing performance (JUnit, Wireshark) and tests automation (JUnit/TestNG). On the client side I worked with HTML, Javascript, GWT and HTML5. I also contributed some code to the GWT project (a list of the issues I worked on can be found here http://gwt-code-reviews.appspot.com/user/markovuksanovic ). \n \nAs part of the project, I implemented a software architecture called Event Bus, which is nowadays a commonly used in GWT web application, and in some form on web applications in general. The architecture received ETK\u2019s internal innovation award for the architecture and was implemented later into the e-health product. \n \nDuring year 2010 Summer Camp in Ericsson I was one of mentors to a group of students who had to implement presentation of medical measurements in HTML5 Canvas element.
