My name is Kenneth Hamilton, but my friends and coworkers call me Kenny. I was a 2015 graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I received a degree in International Business at the Kenan-Flagler Business School with a minor in Philosophy. \n \nI am an avid fan of international travel. Throughout my studies, I have been incredibly fortunate to travel with the Kenan-Flagler Business School to many countries, expand my global knowledge, and interact with students and mentors from across the world. I participated in the March 2013 Global Immersion Elective class that traveled to Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. I am also a participant of Batch 8 of the GLOBE Scholars program, Kenan-Flagler's flagship study abroad program. I, along with 16 other UNC students, studied abroad at the Copenhagen Business School and the Chinese University of Hong Kong during our Junior year. The GLOBE program also entailed study trips to Belgium, Germany, and Indonesia, as well as a number of domestic and international company visits. \n \nMy business passions lie within technology, strategy, and global relations. I love working with products and ideas that can change how the world uses technology to accomplish the tasks of everyday life. I am a passionate speaker and writer, and I love working with and getting to know cultures different from my own.  \n \nI grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, and I was a competitive springboard diver on the national level for 10 years. I love cooking and exploring locally-sourced restaurants, and I am an ace on the mean streets of the Mario Kart raceways. Thanks for reading and feel free to contact me! Summary Hi there!

It's one of the first things I'm asked during an interview and I always give the same answer. I love stories.  \n \nIt started in the fourth grade when I read my first classical mythology story: the myth of Hades and Persephone. Soon I had read \"The Aeneid\" by Virgil, then the twelve labors of Hercules, followed by Homer's \"The Odyssey.\"  \n \nMy interest in Communications arose as an extension of that passion. I want to become more than simply a consumer of stories but a producer of my own content in the communication sphere. \n \nThis understanding of the delicate balance between production and consumption of content makes me unique in a vast landscape of graduating students majoring in PR, Strategic Communications, and journalism who go into the PR, HR, and many other business positions. \n \nI use my passion to provide my pitches, events, and programs with their own personalization informed by the stories my clients want to create.It has served me well in my undergraduate career.  \n \nAnd even as you hear my story of why I became a double major in Classics and Communications at Stanford University, I hope it inspires you to want to know more about me and what I can do for your company.
