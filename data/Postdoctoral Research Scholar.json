Homologous recombination is a complex and highly conserved process that involves the sequential processing of various DNA substrates by dozens of proteins. In humans, the recombination pathway is intimately entangled with DNA replication, the DNA damage response, DNA repair, cell cycle control, apoptosis and telomere maintenance. All of these pathways are implicated in cancer biology. \n \nIn my current role at Stanford, I plan to study the mechanics of chromosome segregation and chromatin assembly, specifically with respect to a specialized region of chromatin called the centromere. \n \nSpecialties: high-resolution fluorescence microscopy, microfluidics, optical trapping, DNA repair & recombination, chromosome biology, genomic instabilityl.

Experience Postdoctoral Research Scholar Stanford University School of Medicine April 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 5 months) Department of Biochemistry I am a Postdoctoral Scholar working in the Straight Lab in the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford University School of Medicine. Accurate chromosome segregation in eukaryotes requires the assembly and function of the centromere\u2013\u2013a highly specialized region of chromatin that serves as the scaffold upon which the kinetochore is assembled. The centromere-kinetochore complex\u2013\u2013composed of more than one hundred proteins bound to several megabases of DNA\u2013\u2013attaches to the mitotic spindle and functions to sense, regulate and generate forces that drive chromosome segregation during cell division. Centromeres are essential components of eukaryotic chromosomes, and defects in centromere assembly and inheritance result in aneuploidy\u2013\u2013a disease-associated state of improper chromosome dosage that causes developmental disorders such as Down\u2019s syndrome and characterizes most human cancers.  \n \nI plan to reconstitute centromeres and kinetochores within microfluidic devices for high-throughput experiments with single-molecule precision and resolution using a range of tools\u2013\u2013molecular and physical\u2013\u2013to dissect and probe centromere structure and function. In doing so, I hope to better understand the mechanics of assembly, what factors are important or dispensable and how native and aberrant centromere-kinetochore complexes respond to physical manipulation mimicking forces from cell division\u2013\u2013all in the effort be better understand the etiology of human diseases arising from improper chromosome segregation. Postdoctoral Scientist, Department of Microbiology & Molecular Genetics UC Davis September 2011  \u2013  March 2014  (2 years 7 months) Davis, CA I was a postdoctoral scientist working in the Kowalczykowski Lab in the Department of Microbiology at UC Davis. I used single-molecule biophysics to visualize and characterize the biochemical activities of the yeast helicase, Sgs1, which is the homologue of the human BLM protein. Genetic defects in BLM are associated with an anomalously high predisposition for developing sporadic cancers due to genomic instability caused by defects in DNA repair and homologous recombination pathways. I was particularly interested in how the biochemical activity of Sgs1 is regulated during DNA double strand break repair by accessory proteins, including Top3, Rmi1, RPA, Rad51, Mre11 and Xrs2. In addition to my work on Sgs1, I also collaborated with several scientists in our group to study the molecular mechanism of BRCA2 during homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair using \"visual biochemical\" techniques. Graduate Student Researcher UC Davis, Department of Microbiology November 2004  \u2013  October 2011  (7 years) I used single-molecule biophysics to directly measure the nucleation and growth rate of RecA filament formation on SSB-coated ssDNA, a process that is facilitated by a class of proteins called mediators, which includes RecFOR in E. coli and BRCA2 in humans.

Accurate chromosome segregation in eukaryotes requires the assembly and function of the centromere\u2013\u2013a highly specialized region of chromatin that serves as the scaffold upon which the kinetochore is assembled. The centromere-kinetochore complex\u2013\u2013composed of more than one hundred proteins bound to several megabases of DNA\u2013\u2013attaches to the mitotic spindle and functions to sense, regulate and generate forces that drive chromosome segregation during cell division. Centromeres are essential components of eukaryotic chromosomes, and defects in centromere assembly and inheritance result in aneuploidy\u2013\u2013a disease-associated state of improper chromosome dosage that causes developmental disorders such as Down\u2019s syndrome and characterizes most human cancers.  \n \nI plan to reconstitute centromeres and kinetochores within microfluidic devices for high-throughput experiments with single-molecule precision and resolution using a range of tools\u2013\u2013molecular and physical\u2013\u2013to dissect and probe centromere structure and function.

Postdoctoral Scientist, Department of Microbiology & Molecular Genetics UC Davis September 2011  \u2013  March 2014  (2 years 7 months) Davis, CA I was a postdoctoral scientist working in the Kowalczykowski Lab in the Department of Microbiology at UC Davis. I used single-molecule biophysics to visualize and characterize the biochemical activities of the yeast helicase, Sgs1, which is the homologue of the human BLM protein. Genetic defects in BLM are associated with an anomalously high predisposition for developing sporadic cancers due to genomic instability caused by defects in DNA repair and homologous recombination pathways. I was particularly interested in how the biochemical activity of Sgs1 is regulated during DNA double strand break repair by accessory proteins, including Top3, Rmi1, RPA, Rad51, Mre11 and Xrs2. In addition to my work on Sgs1, I also collaborated with several scientists in our group to study the molecular mechanism of BRCA2 during homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair using \"visual biochemical\" techniques.

Its aim is to develop a code able to simulate the Helium superfluid (He II) flow motion and its interaction with the magnet cooling. All developments are performed on the OpenFOAM CFD platform. R&D engineer and PhD fellow Air Liquide November 2009  \u2013  October 2012  (3 years) This thesis was a collaboration between the numerical simulation group at the R&D division of Air Liquide and the porous media group of Toulouse Fluid Mechanics Institute. I was in charge to develop 3D macroscale models to simulate two-phase flow and mass transfers in cryogenic distillation columns equipped with structured packings. I successfully defended my dissertation and I get my Ph.D on october 2012. My works have been awarded by the Toulouse University prize (L\u00e9opold Escande prize) and a Toulouse Academy of Sciences prize. \n \nMore specifically, The main tasks were: \n* Theoretical development of a comprehensive macroscopic model using an upscaling methodology to simulate two-phase flow in structured packing including: a turbulent gas flow, a gravity liquid film flow, a multi-component mass transfer with phase change, large scale anisotropy induced by the geometry of the packings. \n \n* Programming of the model within the OpenFOAM CFD toolbox, \n \n* Evaluation of effective properties from pore-scale simulations (permeabilities, dispersion tensors, exchange coefficients...), \n \n* Comparison of the simulation results with experimental data.

To improve the recovery and the productivity of its adsorption unit, as the hydrogen production plants, the company uses Phase Change Material in order to smooth thermal effects in the adsorption columns. I was involved in the development of new thermal models, their implementation in the in-house adsorption processes simulator and their validation by comparison with experiments.  \n \nBeside, I carried out the daily maintenance, and performed simulations in interaction with the engineering teams that work on these processes.  \n \nKey words: porous media, adsorption, PSA, phase change material, non-equilibrium, hydrogen production Engineer Internship Synchrotron SOLEIL June 2007  \u2013  October 2007  (5 months) Paris Area, France Postdoctoral Research Scholar Stanford University October 2013  \u2013 Present (1 year 11 months) Stanford Supri-B: Reservoir Simulation / Pore scale simulations for unconventional hydrocarbon resources / Digital Rock Physics Postdoctoral Research Scholar Stanford University October 2013  \u2013 Present (1 year 11 months) Stanford Supri-B: Reservoir Simulation / Pore scale simulations for unconventional hydrocarbon resources / Digital Rock Physics Research Scientist CERN / IMFT December 2012  \u2013  August 2013  (9 months) Toulouse This project is borned from a joint effort between IMFT (Institut de M\u00e9canique des Fluides \nde Toulouse) and CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in the context of LHC magnet cryogenic cooling by liquid Helium.
