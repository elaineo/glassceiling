In mijn beleving is het belangrijk dat spelers zoveel mogelijk impliciet leren, samen werken om doelen te bereiken en mentale vaardigheden aangereikt krijgen om controle over zichzelf te houden in verschillende situaties. Voetballers verdienen een programma dat zoveel mogelijk individueel op maat is, elke speler is anders.  \n \nOp dit moment volg ik de opleiding sportgezondheid en -management. Na in het eerste jaar mijn propedeuse te hebben behaald, studeer ik op dit moment in het tweede jaar. Binnen deze opleiding heb ik de cursus sportpsychologie succesvol afgerond.

Mijn vooropleiding is CIOS MBO 4 trainer-coach. Tijdens deze opleiding heb ik het groot profiel voetbal gevolgd met als klein profielen loop- en conditietraining en fitness. Binnen het trainen en coachen van jeugdvoetballers beleef ik ontzettend veel plezier om spelers te leren het maximale uit zichzelf te halen. In mijn beleving is het belangrijk dat spelers zoveel mogelijk impliciet leren, samen werken om doelen te bereiken en mentale vaardigheden aangereikt krijgen om controle over zichzelf te houden in verschillende situaties. Voetballers verdienen een programma dat zoveel mogelijk individueel op maat is, elke speler is anders.  \n \nOp dit moment volg ik de opleiding sportgezondheid en -management. Na in het eerste jaar mijn propedeuse te hebben behaald, studeer ik op dit moment in het tweede jaar. Binnen deze opleiding heb ik de cursus sportpsychologie succesvol afgerond.
