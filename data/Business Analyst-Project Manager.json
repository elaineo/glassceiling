Project Manager Intel Corporation January 2012  \u2013  June 2012  (6 months) Human Resources Enterprise Services I manage technical projects that involved working with globally dispersed teams to fix issues with HR global information systems. I identify resource requirements, scope, and timing. I also develop implementation plans and coordinate deployment of the newly developed or enhanced applications between the business and the development teams. These projects consist of improving and optimizing current system tools or fixing issues with the tools. System Analyst Intel November 2005  \u2013  January 2012  (6 years 3 months) Human Resource Enterprise Services I was responsible for the evolution of GWM business group\u2019s software.

This tool efficiently facilitated the validation and parsing of files into a database. The management estimated savings in workload due to this software is around $100K annually. Technician Intel October 2003  \u2013  October 2004  (1 year 1 month) Technology Manufacturing Group My primary responsibilities included meeting weekly production test goals, testing and shipping units that exceed manufacturing quality standards, and training new employees on all test processes. I helped the new hires develop a process to sort out the placement of each Device Under Test (DUT) and its location in the testing process. This increased the speed of the workflow of the testing process, thus increasing revenue because it allowed more units to be tested, reduced the failures at each step of the testing process and resulted in more units that were ready to be sold to the customer. With the new process, units that were ready to be shipped for each week increased dramatically from 60 to 100 units. I also helped the employees develop their computer skills in order to augment their everyday duties.
