Firmware Engineer Embedded Performance, Inc August 1991  \u2013  August 1994  (3 years 1 month) Developed firmware for in-circuit emulators for RISC processors, with special emphasis on execution control, trace disassembly, and silicon errata workarounds. \nAfter previous efforts failed to correctly implement the trace disassembly code for the AMD 29200 processor, I redesigned this code from scratch so that it performed trace disassembly accurately for every possible configuration of the memory controller. My approach used a generic finite state machine driver coupled with a processor-specific state diagram code programmatically, allowing this complex task to be performed in a highly structured manner that was reliable and maintainable. Customer response was very positive, and my design became the model for trace disassembly for all other microprocessor families supported by EPI. \nAs a Test Engineer during my first year at EPI, I developed and deployed the entire manufacturing test environment. Wrote a generic test driver program and processor-specific test modules for in-circuit emulators supporting the AMD 29K, MIPS R3000, and SPARC CY601 processor families.
