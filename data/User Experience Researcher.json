I show how farmers in Northern Finland imagine their identities, and how they enact them in their work and lives. My research highlights the hopes and resentments as well as the practical strategies of farmers in responding to these processes of integration into European markets on the one hand, and the revaluation of their knowledge and engagement with the world on the other. To conclude, I show how the interplay between the practical enactment of personal identity and its discursive construction, at both local and state levels, underwrites the imagination of Finnish national identity both vis-\u00e0-vis neighbouring countries and within the European Union.
