Once I completed my B.S. in Computer Science, I did three Master's Degrees among which I would highlight the one I did at Monash University, Melbourne, on Business Information Systems. To acquire experience with both customers and current technology market, I worked as self-employed during more than three years in a project for the Ministry of Education, becoming coordinator within the first months. Furthermore, I carried out other minor projects as developer and also as a support specialist, trainer and consultant. \n \nAfter that period, I decided to continue my career exploring big technology companies and, in that way, I started working for Google as Technical Support Specialist in January 2013. \n \nAfter several months of training, I am currently working as Enterprise Technical Solutions Engineer since February 2014 in the same previous Google product, Google Apps.
