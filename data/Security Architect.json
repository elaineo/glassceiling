Much of my prior work was with information flow security analysis approaches. This afforded the benefit of being able to articulate and measure coverage goals against known access controls. This provides a great foundation for more advanced approaches of using formal modeling techniques to state and verify security properties in real-world architectures and designs. Much of my interest is in how to fundamentally change the rules of the \"game\". \n \nMy second interest is in the motivation people have for change. Often people and organizations are apathetic to threats until it has directly and demonstrably harmed them. Those harmed, however, aren't always those with the ability to prevent it. How do we motivate change in individual and organizational habits? For businesses, the motivation can come down to financial interests: return on investment. However, businesses are still made of people that make the final call and the decision is not just a net present value calculation. People need to be personally motivated to make the necessary changes for the benefit of others. \n \nAlthough I'm a bit of an idealist and an optimist, I always have to come back around and address reality. The end product must live up to real-world challenges. We have to provide both the methods and the motivation to achieve it.
