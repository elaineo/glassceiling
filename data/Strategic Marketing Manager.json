September 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year) B.C. Canada Visit my web site to understand how to guide your company more effectively --- www.route2profit.com  \n \nI founded Route2Profit-Analytics Inc. to be a Business Forecast Advisor. Analytics provides an inexpensive way for businesses with revenues less than $20M to analyze their aged cash flow, strategic alternatives and ROI. I create a custom P&L forecast so anyone will understand and can defend the business's forecasted cash flow needs, R&D, and marketing strategy.  \n \nI do more than an accountant who just \u201cruns the forecast numbers\u201d as given. I help the company actually discuss assumptions and test the impact of alternatives. My 20+ years experience in marketing and executive management helps people understand if they are being realistic about target markets, R&D, revenue growth and sales expenses. Especially, do they understand the costs and benefits associated with the various options to \u201cgo to market\u201d. \n \nSmall businesses do not do enough (if any) formal business planning or analysis of their revenue generators in order to understand cash flow needs and how to grow the business more effectively. Good ideas don't turn themselves into successful ventures without going through an extensive analysis. No business is too small or can\u2019t afford my services. I can tailor the project to fit your company\u2019s needs, big or small. \n \nI do not want to create your full business plan, I just want to help you create your financial forecast and analyze your business options and their credibility. You should never trust an Excel template that forces you to fit your business into a prebuilt format.
