I spent four years at Oberlin College, a liberal arts school in Ohio, obtaining my Bachelors in Economics with a focus on Mathematics. During the summers I would intern with Pace Global, now a part of Siemens, doing energy consulting and finance. After graduating from college I spent two years in Baltimore working in corporate loans for Morgan Stanley. I began on the primary origination side, most heavily involved in managing the regulatory oversight process for new loans. I traveled to India to oversee an outsourcing initiative that saw much of our operations functions moved to a vendor. I was in charge of training, setting up procedures, and managing our overseas group. I am currently a Senior Financial Analyst at Intel Corporation.
