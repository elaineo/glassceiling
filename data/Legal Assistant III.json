Experience UXA Design Producer Google October 2014  \u2013 Present (10 months) San Francisco Bay Area The Unified Experience Alliance (UXA) team works closely with all product areas across Google to create the next-gen product design spec. This includes a section of standards and specifications unique to Google\u2019s own suite of apps and may be used as a resource for any design team in the company. We are currently working on implementing Material Design, Google's bold new UI, inspired by the study of paper and ink, and grounded in tactile physical reality.  \n \nAs a Design Producer (ie. Program Manager), I work cross-org/cross-product, and collaborate with managers, designers and engineering teams to define milestones, secure and assign resources, assess risks, and help meet deadlines. I also manage project-related communications to team members, leaders and other stakeholders.  \n \nMy current focus is Imagery, which consists of developing build guidelines, a request system, a gallery and repository for photography and illustrations. I'm quickly learning how to be an expert juggler, a master planner and a flexible project manager who can balance multiple projects that always span continents, product areas, and disciplines.
