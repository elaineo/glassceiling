Graduate Research Assistant University of Texas at El Paso, System Software Engineering Lab 1997  \u2013  1999  (2 years) El Paso, Texas Investigated a scientific workload and reported performance results on a processor for the POEMS program. POEMS (Performance Oriented End-to-end Modeling of large scale heterogeneous parallel/distributed computational Systems) was a multi-university collaboration of efforts involving UT Austin, Rice, UCLA, UTEP, Purdue, UW Madison and Los Alamos National Labs (LANL).
