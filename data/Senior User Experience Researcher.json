I show how farmers in Northern Finland imagine their identities, and how they enact them in their work and lives. My research highlights the hopes and resentments as well as the practical strategies of farmers in responding to these processes of integration into European markets on the one hand, and the revaluation of their knowledge and engagement with the world on the other. To conclude, I show how the interplay between the practical enactment of personal identity and its discursive construction, at both local and state levels, underwrites the imagination of Finnish national identity both vis-\u00e0-vis neighbouring countries and within the European Union.

Manager, User Experience Research - Google Maps Google January 2011  \u2013  August 2014  (3 years 8 months) Mountain View, California I joined the Google Maps team in January of 2011. I led research for a growing product suite of Google Maps products for Enterprise users. In 2012, I transitioned to work on \"local search\", tending to all those experiences related to finding places to go and things to see using Google. At that time I also took on the responsibility of overseeing research for the Google Maps team based in Mountain View. I managed all of Google Maps related research (mobile, desktop, automotive) from January - August 2014.

For each lecture, I also brought in UCD practitioners from industry to give their perspectives on the lecture topics and assist the students with their class projects.  \n \nThe class aimed to match the academic foundations of UCD with current trends in industry through concrete examples and guest speakers. This was so students could apply the ideas in their academic and industry work as quickly and effectively as possible.
