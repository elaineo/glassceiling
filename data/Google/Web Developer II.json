I was required to work on many different websites that utilized a wide variety of different web technologies. Technologies included using a Content Management System called Expression Engine, which allowed me to create templated website that could then be used by a client who has little or no knowledge of the web. The purpose of this was so that the client can manage their own website without the need to contact us for every minor update. I also used JavaScript in quite a lot of the websites I developed to create better functionality. I used PHP in some of the websites to create forms, which would allow for clients to get feedback, or in some cases allow online bookings. I also used Flash to create more dynamic feeling websites.

I have now got experience using a variety of CMS systems. www.iheartau.com Junior Web Developer Studio Juice September 2008  \u2013  April 2009  (8 months) During my time in London I worked for a design studio in a web development role. I was required to work on many different websites that utilized a wide variety of different web technologies. Technologies included using a Content Management System called Expression Engine, which allowed me to create templated website that could then be used by a client who has little or no knowledge of the web. The purpose of this was so that the client can manage their own website without the need to contact us for every minor update. I also used JavaScript in quite a lot of the websites I developed to create better functionality. I used PHP in some of the websites to create forms, which would allow for clients to get feedback, or in some cases allow online bookings. I also used Flash to create more dynamic feeling websites.
