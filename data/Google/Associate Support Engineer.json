Mountain View, CA Sociogramics' vision is to return character and community to the core practices of financial institutions with an emphasis on the 80+ million in the U.S. who are unbanked, under-banked and those new to credit (such as recent immigrants and youth). Benefits to financial institutions, such as credit granters, depositories and insurers include increased lifetime account value, real-time life event insights, deepened customer engagement, fraud prevention and reduced delinquencies. Sociogramics was founded by serial entrepreneur and champion of social good, Gary Kremen (founder of both Match.Com and Clean Power Finance), and is backed by a consortium of leading national venture capital funds. Senior Software Engineer Netflix 2010  \u2013  2012  (2 years) Built 100% of the new framework for building movie ranking systems within Netflix.

One CEO comment was \"Reed commented, in his usual style as a question to Neil, that we have never seen such high [customer] retention gain for any test in the past\". Another CEO comment was that customer retention was equivalent to spending an additional $25million/month on streaming content. Version 2 has 200% higher performance than version 1.

Senior Research Scientist Motorola Human Interface Labs 1999  \u2013  2003  (4 years) Palo Alto, CA Added discriminative training and input transforms to the Motorola software tools. This resulted in a ten-fold decrease in model size for Motorola\u2019s speech recognizer and a 50% decrease in error rate for Motorola\u2019s handwriting recognizer. To the best of my knowledge these systems hold the record for the highest performance achieved on the databases used. \nConsultant to the eSensor DNA array product group \u2013 part of Motorola Life Sciences (http://www.motorola.com/lifesciences/esensor). I am the sole investigator in this project. My original project proposal was used by life sciences to obtain a NIMA grant. Approximately $150,000 of this was given to our site for payment for my services. The project was a proposal to improve the signal detection algorithm. This detector algorithm analyzes the electrical signals from the electrochemical cell and infers the presence or absence of targeted DNA sequences. Our current detector has 4 times more sensitivity, is 1/10 of the size and is 20 times faster than the baseline life sciences implementation.
