Everything we do is in service of the idea. Organized around the belief that Innovation is the most powerful form of marketing\u2122, our team of Thinkers and Makers invent, prototype and commercialize new products, services and experiences that help brands realize their potential in profound new ways. \n \nWe believe that the best way to change a consumer\u2019s perception of a brand is to change the way they experience it. We ask provocative questions until we unlock a new way to see your consumer, your brand or your organization. \n \nWe innovate for the real world through a deep focus on the culture around us. We understand how people truly live and how to better solve for their everyday needs as well as their fantasies. \n \nWe believe that being disruptive in the marketplace differentiates our clients' brands and enables them to leapfrog the competition. We innovate to transform categories by disrupting the conventions and forces that others follow. \n \nIn the role of director, Gina oversees a multidisciplinary team of talented industrial and graphic designers who work across multiple categories creating new innovative products, services and futures for ambitious large as well as small brands.
