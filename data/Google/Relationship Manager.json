University, I joined Google\u2019s then-nascent advertising sales team in Boston. There, as a Relationship Manager, I led a client team spanning two offices to grow a $XXm portfolio of 15 east coast digital agencies through new acquisitions and end-client upsells (same-store).  \n \nIn 2010, I moved to the Google UK direct sales team, where I was entrusted with C-level relationship management and ad revenue growth of some of the Europe\u2019s largest, and most complex, multichannel travel brands. I conceived of and created new types of data analysis, which transformed the way that UK tour operators bought their online media (principally, search), resulting in $XXXk of additional revenue within just a 6 month period. Beyond changing old media-buying behaviours, I regularly presented compelling insights for many of my clients, which led to new approaches to their brand narrative, core product or audience. \n \nIn 2013, I shifted from working on the marketing challenges of my clients to doing the same for Google. I led the brand development of Connected Classrooms, a new Google platform that brings educational experts to classrooms around the world via Hangouts. Finally, I initiated and led the overhaul of the 2014 Google Science Fair website for content, UX and design.  \n \nMost recently, I joined the Google UK marketing team as a Product Marketing Manager for AdWords (small- and medium-sized businesses), focusing on lead generation and nurturing, new customer acquisition, onboarding and retention. My mission is to acquire, grow and delight new AdWords customers, and most importantly, to maximise their success.
