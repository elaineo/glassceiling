Prototyper / Information Architect Yahoo!7 February 2007  \u2013  November 2008  (1 year 10 months) I relocated to Sydney, to join the User Experience & Design team at Yahoo!7. We were responsible not only for defining the look and feel of all Yahoo! products in AU & NZ, but the ideation of entirely new products and services utilizing the content available from local partners: Seven TV and Pacific Magazines. Our work also fed back into the global UED organization and we contributed processes and design/interaction patterns which have been taken up internationally. I delivered the keynote address for Australia at the Global UED Summit held at Yahoo! Headquarters in Sunnyvale in 2007. \n \nMy role was interdisciplinary in nature, bridging a large number of areas of design and development, and requiring close collaboration with many areas of the business. I had to carefully balance brand, market and user requirements, remaining mindful of the need to incorporate advertising elements throughout - in as un-obtrusive way as possible. I participated variously in: product, experience and interaction design, information architecture, SEO, front & back-end engineering, and innovation. I produced a range of prototypes with a mix of techniques, which were vital for usability testing sessions. I greatly enjoyed working with Yahoo!'s wide range of APIs, and promoting them both internally and externally. \n \nI was instrumental in the planning and redesign of the front pages of both the Australian and New Zealand Yahoo! portals.I was responsible for single-handedly creating the main Flash switcher module, prominently featured on both pages - from visual design to prototyping, production development, editorial integration, front and back-end integration, testing and QA. \n \nPost-launch, the switchers are credited with having increased user-engagement on these vitally important front pages by a large percentage - an improvement worth a significant dollar value.

As well as integrating Flash elements with their Vignette CMS, I was responsible for setting up and maintaining an independent development environment, including databases and back-end systems, to allow us to host our work under a less restrictive security regime. I created a portfolio of Flash modules, in collaboration with our team of graphic designers, hooking them into the back-end systems. I successfully ran several viral-marketing campaigns, mail-outs, games, competitions and promotions from the system, building up the audience, and adding value for the advertisers. \n \nA major project at Telecom was undertaking a redesign of the XtraMSN web portal - in particular the front page. It was critical for the success of the business that we dramatically increase our audience figures, in the lead up to a proposed new deal with Yahoo! after the expiry of the MSN partnership. I developed a flash-based interactive switcher module, to be the primary focus of the new front page. This module efficiently loaded and displayed up to 60 featured story items, with images, in a small space. The switcher incorporated a number of innovative user-interface features, such as mouse-gesture recognition, animated timed transitions, pre-emptive loading strategies and sensitive responses to the behavior of the user. These designs were put through several cycles of rapid-iterative testing in the usability lab, until we were confident that it was sufficiently refined. The results greatly exceeded expectations, boosting the audience when it was most needed. This was a significant factor in achieving the successful completion of the merger deal, and I was hired by the new organization, to provide the same transformative interface services for Yahoo!

After training, this system was able to distinguish between 6 distinct mental states solely by analysis of previously-unseen EEG data.
