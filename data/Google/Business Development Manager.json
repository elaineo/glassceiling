The mission of Google for Education is to help transform education by providing open technology that improves learning for everyone, everywhere. \n \nFor over 16 years, I have been working with organisations around the world to help them use technology to become more collaborative, creative, and innovative. \n \nAs you can tell, I am passionate about bringing the power of Google technology to K-12 education. So, if you are interested in learning how Google is helping schools transform education in the US and around the world, I\u2019d be happy to discuss multiple case studies of client successes, and share insights that can help your organisation. \n \nSpecialties:Education Technology, Chromebook. Google Apps for Education, 1-to1 computing, Education Transformation, Android for Education, Tablets for Education, Google Play for Education, Change Management, Online Assessments, PARCC, Smarter Balance As consumers, students, parents and employees, you have seen the way technology has transformed the way we find information and learn. We experience it every day with tools like Google Search, Gmail, Chrome and many other technologies that have changed the way we live, learn and collaborate. \n \nIf you give kids the web, they never stop learning. When the web is open and tools affordable, it evens the playing field in education. Learning should be accessible beyond the classroom: for anyone, from any device, anywhere. Learning should be a collaborative experience that inspires lifelong curiosity. Transforming education today better prepares students for the modern world. \n \nTechnology alone does not transform education. It takes a collaborative effort from everyone involved. Whether you\u2019re a student, a teacher, a school administrator, a parent or policy-maker, we all play a part in this journey to transform the way students learn and thrive, from kindergarten all the way through university. \n \nMy name is Richard Ach\u00e9e, and I work with strategic partners in Google for Education.
