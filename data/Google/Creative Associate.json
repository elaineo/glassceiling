It feels good to be free.  \n \nI've been in the industry for a while now: first as a content editor for TV and digital, and for the last 12 years, as a Creative Director.  \n \nFor the last four years, I have built and managed Google\u2019s Creative Team in Brazil, The Zoo, as a Creative Director. That's my current do. Our mission is to work closely with brands and agencies using Google\u2019s Pandora box of technology to help them envision and shape more engaging campaigns. \n \nPrior to Google, I had my own creative digital shop in Brazil, Vinil, from 2004 to 2011. Small in size, but huge in determination and passion. My only desire was to go deep on interesting experiences for people and take brands from a monologue to a dialogue. \n \nI made it. Had the chance to build a creative business from scratch and work with powerful brands, cool brands, hypster brands and not very cool brands. Lots of interesting work, learnings, but little time for self promotion and it was a huge time investment: 7 years of no vacations, late nights, and weekends-- but I was full of energy and inspiration.  \n \nThose were tough times. It was the beginning of the digital age for everyone. And for brands and agencies there was no successful stories to imitated, or to \u201cget inspired by\u201d; no track of results, it was a black hole (not a white board). It took a while for the advertising and design industry to understand that \u201cdigital\u201d was not just a bunch of programmers coding or playing games, it was part of the entire world we live in-- a fully connected world with no boundaries. \n \nToday, digital is pure joy waiting to be experienced and embedded in people\u2019s life and brands communication.  \n \nAnd my purpose in life is to be happy and work hard with inspiring and brave people, invest my precious time in initiatives that can somehow enhance people\u2019s life, including, mine. \n \n Summary This is my page, so I edit it the way I want.
