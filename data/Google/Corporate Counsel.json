In short, I incubate new products and scale existing products through partnerships.  \n \nI joined Google in August 2010 as part of its acquisition of virtual goods monetization company, Jambool, where I served as VP, Business and Legal Affairs. Prior to Jambool, I spent 9 years at Yahoo! in senior legal and business development roles, focused on search, shopping, local and travel.
