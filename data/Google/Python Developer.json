Multimedia Developer Queensland Police Service 2004  \u2013  2007  (3 years) As a multimedia developer for the Education, Training and Support Program, I was responsible for developing eLearning multimedia resources for flexible delivery, deployed both internally and externally. As a member of a team of professionals, I worked on a range of projects that required technical multimedia skills and front-end web development skills.  \n \nOne of the greatest challenges was creating great websites without the use of any server side technologies (due to security limitations). Implementing features such as a state saving online assessment systems in pure JavaScript was a great experience and was where I first started heavily using JavaScript and jQuery.

I am a HTML5 evangelist, proficent with CSS and accompanying browser rendering issues on different platforms. \n \nI have strong functional and OO background trying to accurately mix both styles according to problem that needs to be solved. I've been always following Zen of Python in this area preferring easy solutions to complex problems. \n \nI have experience with programing and maintaining broad variety of database systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL and more. These days I prefer noSQL system more where MongoDB is my favourite as it feels much more appropriate for python philosophy than relation databases. \n \nBesides Python I am proficient with C/C++. I frequently weave both with help of ctypes. I of course know SQL and pg/plsql. I did large codebase in PHP. I also eagerly program in JavaScript. \n \nI am long-time UNIX-based OS user. I can administer and monitor Linux based machines. I am familar and a big fan of Amazon Web Services. I've been using Amazon EC2, EBS, S3, SES, VPC a lot both at my previous job and privately.
