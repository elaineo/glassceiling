Ruby on Rails. Experience Product Manager Google January 2012  \u2013 Present (3 years 8 months) London, United Kingdom My new role title reflects a slight change in focus from when I was a Technical Programme Manager: although before I was responsible for the products I have, this new role more firmly moves into the Product Management sphere, moving away from day to day technical delivery and having more time for more strategic product lifecycle concerns: adoption, ROI, user feedback, but keeping user experience, stakeholder management, release management, PRD and feature prioritisation I did before. Technical Programme Manager Google April 2011  \u2013  December 2011  (9 months) I manage a portfolio of internal products for Google's huge global sales force. Heading the global project office I'm leading the adoption and proficiency of agile / lean practices across the dozen workstreams that are in place at any given time. Customer Solutions Engineer and Agile Coach Google January 2010  \u2013  April 2011  (1 year 4 months) I design and build software that generates revenue for Google. I also help educate other groups internally and externally on similar objectives. Technologies and products used will cover pretty much all Google technologies.  \n \nI continue to hold a parallel role in the global Agile practices team supporting and training other teams in agile methods. \n \nQualifications: Google Certified Professional for AdWords, Analytics, and Website Optimizer Technical Account Manager (TAM) and Agile Coach Google January 2008  \u2013  January 2010  (2 years 1 month) Responsible for working with Google partners in the EMEA region to ensure technical delivery and overall relationship well-being of partner-related initiatives, either in-bound (services and customisations needed by Google, from partner) or out-bound (services and customisations needed by partner, from Google).

Technical Project Manager Practiv Applied Software Ltd January 2003  \u2013  July 2006  (3 years 7 months) Successfully delivered UK's leading online protection solution (Friends Provident eSelect) to production in early 2003 and helped shape and evolve it over the subsequent 2 years. It has since won 11 awards. \n \nThen moved to a similar 'me too' project at BUPA but focused more on a mixture of technical, business project management with some ebusiness consulting as well. Technical Project Manager ATG March 2002  \u2013  November 2002  (9 months) ATG and Sun worked with Telefonica to build their PDSL platform in 2002. It was a pretty wizzy system which offered things like video game rental, videoconferencing, etc. The ATG team were sharp and I was able to contribute to the code base at one point to work with order processing and suchlike; but by and large my job was to help keep the project focused and on-track. It was chaotic; Telefonica aren't much fun to work with. Alan, Pat and Xavi rock and I wouldn't hesitate in working with any of them in future (hopefully they'll link up at some point) 'Local CTO' IconMediaLab 2001  \u2013  2001  (less than a year) Swedish stock-exchange-listed IconMediaLab was almost 'pure product' of the Dot Com Boom. Flush with cash these guys rapidly grew to have 1800 people in 32 plush offices worldwide (their SF offices cost $US60k/month, $1m to set up and they committed to a 10 year lease). But there wasn't a lot of substance to their strategy and when times got rough, it imploded.  \n \nSo my stint in their Barcelona office was interesting. I certainly learnt a lot about how not to manage an office by the MD there, and some insight into what the CTO role involves. I wasn't really ready for that role to be honest; but it was the first step in my move away from 'pure tech' to a leadership track. I had a team of 16 people -- some of whom didn't speak English, and I focused on team career development, selling & educating technology to clients, and process improvement. I had a desk on the 28th floor of a building in Barcelona where I could see the beach below. It was nice. I had fun; it was never going to last. Senior Java / ATG Developer eDreams November 1999  \u2013  September 2000  (11 months) Java software developer where I learnt ATG Dynamo. Occasional project manager and team leader, working initially in San Francisco then later Barcelona of what could only be called a mad place to work at the time. Mad but immensely fun.

Research programmer University of Auckland 1993  \u2013  1997  (4 years) This was a Mac / Unix environment. My career highlights from this age was to write a portable communications library, 'platform independent packets' which was source-compatible with Mac front end clients (8Mhz Mac SEs mostly!) and our Digital Unix back ends. Through some 4-byte char hacks I managed to get code that would send binary-compatible data even though the front end was big endian and the back end was little-endian. [Learn more on endianness: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness] \n \nI rewrote the Computer Science Department's resource management suite: machine bookings, printing, and internet data usage, the latter is when students had to pay for internet traffic. The latter, 'Net Guardian', was then rolled out across the University of Auckland, renamed 'Net Account'. \n \nMac GUIs were very sophisticated for the time, based on a GUI library I cowrote with a friend of mine, Richard Knuckey. We called it The Screen Manager and it should've rocked the world, but we got hung up on commercial issues.
