I currently work on mobile and tablet apps, but I have done a lot of work on server side hosting and APIs. I am most happy as an Individual Contributor on a team building something cool, rather than taking on the role of planning, coordinating, or managing other people. \n \nI test the software that I build, I push back against unrealistic expectations, and I give thoughtful feedback on product design and features. That said, when a decision gets made, I execute it, even though I might not entirely agree with it. I am honest and direct, and can view feedback in the manner it was intended. \n \nAnd I get along with QA engineers really well. Summary I am a software engineer.

Web Suggest - Software Engineer III, Tech Lead Google September 2006  \u2013  November 2007  (1 year 3 months) Mountain View, CA - Web Suggest is the feature that completes your query as you type in the search box. It started out as an experimental feature developed by 20% contributors. I was the first full-time engineer on the project. \n- As the Tech Lead of a 5-engineer team, productionized the system and graduated the product from experimental status. Drove the launch of the product in Asian markets (China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong). Achieved 25% feature adoption, increased average query length by 2%, and saved adopted users 48% keystrokes. \n- Using a Bayesian bigram model trained with query data in web logs, built the Chinese pinyin suggest feature that enabled Chinese users to input pinyin and get a list of matched Chinese character query completions. This greatly improved the search experience of Chinese users, allowing them to perform searches even when they do not have IME installed.

Experience Staff Software Engineer, Tech Lead, Manager Google 2013  \u2013 Present (2 years) Krak\u00f3w, Poland Lead a team of 8 engineers building a machine learning platform. Deployed as a collection of services behind a Web UI, the platform features model hosting, training, online and batch scoring, evaluation, and introspection, and supports binary\u00ad and multi\u00adclassification models, and ranking models. The platform is used by several teams, and it is closely integrated with several production workflows. I have designed the system, and implemented one of the services (a training service). I have managed the project using Agile methods. I have lead collaborations with user and partner teams, in Mountain View and New York. \n Staff Software Engineer, People Manager Google 2012  \u2013  2013  (1 year) Krak\u00f3w, Poland Managed an organization of 22 engineers, focused on advertiser acquisition. The org has built a range of tools and systems, from support systems used by Marketing & Sales, to prediction services, to handling promotional AdWords coupons. \n \nThe latter is an externally\u00ad facing service that handles redemption and fulfillment tracking of coupons, and it has been key in driving advertiser acquisition. I have co-\u00adauthored initial system designs, and later, managed the team in building and launching the system. I have coordinated integration of the system with Ads and Billing, negotiating timelines and driving between engineering, product, and business teams in Krak\u00f3w and Mountain View. \n Staff Software Engineer, Tech Lead, Manager Google 2010  \u2013  2012  (2 years) Krak\u00f3w, Poland Lead a team of 8-\u00ad10 engineers building an analytical SQL query service for large scale data warehouses. The system consisted of a query execution service and a rule-\u00adbased query optimizer. The execution service featured a novel evaluation engine, open-sourced at code.google.com/p/supersonic/, significantly out\u00ad-performing other similar solutions at Google. I have been an architect and a lead developer of Supersonic. Additionally I have lead an effort to increase reliability and scalability of the execution service. These efforts increased the maximum size of query-able data sets by 5x, yielded overall 30% performance gains end-\u00adto-\u00adend, and up to 5x speedup for a class of queries. \n Senior Software Engineer Google 2008  \u2013  2010  (2 years) Krak\u00f3w, Poland As a Tech Lead / Manager, lead a team of 7-\u00ad10 engineers, building Google's resource utilization monitoring infrastructure. I have been a lead designer of foundational service interfaces that allow Google infrastructure services, owned by various distributed teams, to uniformly report their quota and usage data. I have negotiated the interfaces with infrastructure teams, and brought ~10 initial services on board. \n \nI have lead and largely implemented a MapReduce-\u00adbased data aggregation pipeline, designed a datacube schema, and lead the team in delivering a reporting solution, serving parametrizable resource utilization reports in UI dashboards. \n Software Engineer Google April 2007  \u2013  2010  (3 years) Krak\u00f3w, Poland Implemented a monitoring agent that collects and reports resource usage data (CPU, RAM, etc.) by production tasks, at 1s resolution. As of 2015, this agent still runs on every production server.

The rest should follow. \n \nI have worked on and led large-scale complex projects serving hundreds of thousands of requests per second with latencies measured in low milliseconds as an individual contributor, tech lead and also manager in teams consisting up to 20 people. These projects are all highly technical, requiring deep understanding of subjects such as Bayesian statistics and information retrieval. They range from being \"legacy\"\u200b projects where the challenge is to revitalize the project by building and driving a new vision for the team, to \"pie-in-the-sky\"\u200b projects where the challenge is to design and implement a solution that delivers a specified product goal. \n \nI operate firmly on the basis of \"if you are not evaluating changes, you are not building a product\" mentality, and believe in designing and using testing methodologies such as A/B testing to guide quality iterations.
