{"position": "Software Engineering Practicum Intern - Hourly", "company": "Google", "profiles": ["Summary I am detail oriented. I am passionate about using computer science to solve complex problems in the most elegant ways possible. I enjoy designing large-scale systems to be efficient, extensible, and as easy to use as possible. \n \nI have a passion for helping people. I love working on projects which help or improve someone's life. Whether this is a game which helps people block out their problems in life for a few minutes of playing or a simple feature on a website which saves 10 seconds of time. Anything which improves someone's life is well worth any effort to design and build it. \n \nMy two main objectives are completing what needs to get done when it needs to be done and to learn as much as I can while getting it there. I recognize the imperative importance in finishing a task by a certain deadline and I work as hard as I can to meet that deadline. If I have a little more time, I like to try and spend it approaching a problem with a more complicated approach that has better benefits, both for the learning experience and additional benefits the solution has.

Experience Software Engineering Intern Google May 2015  \u2013 Present (3 months) Math and CS Tutor DigiPen Institute of Technology September 2013  \u2013  April 2015  (1 year 8 months) I help students who need help with Mathematics in the courses of Linear Algebra; Differential and Integral Calculus; Differential Equations; and Discrete Mathematics. I also help students with ANSI C, C++, data structures, graphics programming, and algorithms. Software Engineering Intern Google May 2014  \u2013  August 2014  (4 months) Santa Monica, CA Software Engineer Google Summer of Code 2013 June 2013  \u2013  September 2013  (4 months) I created a unified, cross-platform meta-build system for Simple DirectMedia Layer 2.0. This was done using a modified version of Premake 5. The meta-build script provided build support with Visual Studio 2008, 2010, and 2012, Xcode 3 and 4, and GNU Makefiles on both Windows using MinGW and Linux (tested with Linux Mint). \n \nBlog detailing work: http://gsocben.blogspot.com/ Website Developer enove October 2011  \u2013  July 2012  (10 months) I worked on backend website development, mostly in PHP with an IIS webserver and MySQL database. My work for backend development included implementing a session-based image management system for guaranteeing a user is not able to right click and download an image from a website for all web browsers compliant to web standards. Sped up image loading time by making use of automatically generated thumbnails of the huge larger images. \n \nI worked on frontend development. Implemented a slideshow for continuously displaying large-scale images using a cross-browser approach with jQuery (though not using jQuery's animation features). \n \nImplemented a steganography-based security system for imagess wherein all images were trackable for hidden copyright information so the website owner could verify legal ownership of copied property that wasn't altered too severely. Programmer Lakeland College January 2012  \u2013  May 2012  (5 months) Collected information, URLs, and helped design which pages would be displayed on a mobile application to be used by Lakeland College students. Their existing application was being recreated by Blackboard, Inc. and I was working as a liaison between Lakeland College and Blackboard developers. I created a Java application to convert a database dump of Lakeland course information to a CSV file for Blackboard programmers to use within the application.
