Product Manager in Stockholm where I lead Google's WebRTC platform. Real Time Communication (RTC) and Product Management are my areas of expertise and interest. I am also site lead for Google's Stockholm engineering office.  \n \nI moved to Sweden in 1997 to start a PhD. There, I helped I co-found Marratech AB in 1998, developing software for multi user video communication. At Marratech, I got to work across several functions: Starting a company, setting up engineering, marketing, business plans and investor relations.  \n \nIn 2007, after a year of consulting, our software code was sold to Google and key employees joined the search engine company.  \n \nMy first project was within the Google Talk team, where we launched the Gmail voice and video chat software, used by millions within Gmail, iGoogle and Orkut. \n \nI also started the project that developed into Google Hangouts video communication platform. I also started the GVC project, which resulted in Chromebox for Meetings later on.  \n \nIn 2009, I lead the acquisition of Global IP Solutions (GIPS). The goal of this was to give voice, video and data communication capabilities to the web, something we called WebRTC. WebRTC is a Javascript API that enables Peer to Peer audio, video and data communication between web browsers, iOS and Android.  \n \n= Google is hiring in Sweden = \nGoogle has an important engineering presence in Stockholm:  \n \n\u2022 Hangouts and Chromebox for Meetings \nWe provide the scalable, reliable infrastructure for RTC at Google.
