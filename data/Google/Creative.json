These were challenging years and I've worked as a senior creative on projects for global brands like Unilever, Eurostar, Sony, Guinness and a few others.  \n \nIn 2010 I moved to fast-paced S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, where I'm currently based. Here I worked as a Creative Director at AgenciaClickIsobar, responsible for the integrated FIAT account and later had the same role for Nivea.  \n \nAfter a prolific stint at AgenciaClick, in March 2012 I left to found the creative lab SE\u00d1ORES, with a few collaborators based in NYC and London. It's focused on developing high impact communication and innovation projects. Both coming from a client's brief or proprietary, which turns out to be at the same time hugely fun and daunting. \n \nIn between all that, back in 2011, I've started running a creativity workshop at MiamiAdSchool. Thankfully, it became a great success among creatives and planners and we had people from the likes of Nike and Google Creative Labs taking part.  \n \nLife's been busy in the tropics. \n \nSpecialties: Creative Direction, Art Direction, Typography, Interactive,  \nCreative Strategy and working hard to add Writing to the list.

Creative at Publicis Seattle. Previously, freelanced around New York at BBH, 360i and Publicis for over a year. Before that, worked full-time at BBDO/Proximity NY (Sr. Art Director) working mainly on Visa (FIFA, Olympics, Signature and Prepaid). I also spent some years at SapientNitro (Coca-Cola & Powerade - FIFA) and at AlmaDDB (StateFarm, McDonald's and Pepsi).  \n \nExperienced in both digital and traditional advertising. I love every part of the creative process, specially the ideating / concepting stages. My focus is art direction, but I write whenever possible (I have done some of the writing on past agency and personal projects). Have worked on several sports centered projects.  \n \nI teach. I have been an instructor at Miami Ad School since 2010 - taught Everything is Media, Interactive Concepts and Head to Head (competitions class) both at the Miami and Brooklyn locations. I have also done guest lectures at NYU and have been a part-time lecturer at the University of Miami.  \n \nFamily guy. Married to Nadia. Parents of Toulouse (our shiny-gray-coat Weimaraner).  \n \nFootball. F\u00fatbol. \u02c8fo\u035dot\u02ccb\u00f4l. I seem to gravitate towards soccer a bit - at work, at home or at a stadium (Nacional and Uruguay) and sometimes, on the pitch.  \n \nMusician. I play guitar (+ some charango) and sing [badly]. Compose music and lyrics whenever possible. Slightly obsessed with trying to play Hendrix songs.
