Google Search, partner websites on the Google Display Network and YouTube. This advice includes account optimisations and troubleshooting, specifically about campaign performance, advertising policies, billing/invoicing and Google Analytics. I have a specialisation in Google Analytics, which measures user actions on a website after clicking on an ad. This is a more technical product and by working with it, I'm developing a better understanding in technical matters while at the same time giving practical advice on how to best work with the Analytics data. \n \nI'm also leading the official Dutch AdWords Help forum, which includes moderation and working together with the Top Contributors on the forum. Additionally I'm running a project aimed at providing valuable and relevant information on the forum. In collaboration with subject experts, I'm publishing product-related knowledge and optimization advice on the forum to best serve Dutch advertisers. Financial Auditor in the Audit of Accounts Asset | FIRST International September 2011  \u2013  August 2014  (3 years) Tilburg Along with two other former Treasurers of Asset | FIRST, I checked the financial books of Asset | FIRST International bimonthly. Together, we gave budgetary advice to the current Treasurer of the study association. Although the advice was not binding, the Audit of Accounts committee ensured that spendings were in the best interest of both general and active members. Online Media Associate Intern (Dutch) Google July 2012  \u2013  September 2012  (3 months) Dublin, Ireland As a summer intern at Google, I managed a project on service improvement. The project entailed a viability analysis, presentation of findings in several teams, progress reports and the analysis of implementation results. Further, I was involved in AdWords policy and took on the role of Lead of the AdWords Help Center in Dutch. The latter entailed localisation, reviewing content of articles and (voice)recording of 10 videos to help new AdWords users set up their accounts. Treasurer (full-time board member) Asset | FIRST International September 2010  \u2013  September 2011  (1 year 1 month) Tilburg, Netherlands In between my Bachelor's and Master's, I took a gap year in which I took on a full-time role as Treasurer of the study association in in a board of six students. My responsibilities were to take care of all financial matters within the association. This included bookkeeping and providing financial support to Treasurers of all 17 committees. Throughout the year, I also coordinated seven committees of students who organized and designed for the association. I also shared responsibilities for promotion of the associations and its activities. During the year, I created a concept for a new, more interactive and challenging event to replace a less successful event. The association still organizes this event, the Quest, anually.
