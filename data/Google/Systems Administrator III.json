Network Administrator JD Powers and Associates December 2006  \u2013  August 2008  (1 year 9 months) Even though this position said Network Administrator, my duties made me a Systems Administrator. Within JDPA, administrated and maintained the Linux grid farm, backups of said farm and of data inside multiple MYSQL database servers, CVS systems, and on the EMC NAS and SAN systems using both sata and fiber channel drive systems. Developed scripts to ensure data integrity and any other general or advanced IT issues that may arise at Umbria needing any automation and to further streamline administration and detection using CFengine, Splunk, Wiki, and Nagios in order to reduce the lead time on issues. These support servers were ran with Apache HTTP and Tomcat to ensure ROI's were met quickly and cheaply.
