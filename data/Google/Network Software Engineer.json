Senior Software Engineer (AdWords Optimizations) Google July 2013  \u2013  May 2015  (1 year 11 months) Greater New York City Area Worked on discovering significant features that impact AdWords' keyword performance. \nDesigned and implemented a new pipeline to compute customer's keywords quality score. \nDesigned models of customer behavior on Google AdWords Opportunities Tabs \nUsed machine learning tools and other heuristics to rank optimization suggestions presented to customers on Google AdWords Opportunities Tab \n \nTools: R, MySql, MapReduce/Hadoop Senior Software Engineer (Storage Infrastructure) Google October 2010  \u2013  2013  (3 years) Greater New York City Area Leveraged Google storage infrastructure to design and build SYNC functionality that allows users to sync their data incrementally from the Google cloud. (The technology is used by Chrome browser to continuously SYNC user bookmarks, history and other data across devices). \nWorked on storage infrastructure for user-centric data. \nConducted experiments and analysis on data consistency properties of various Google storage systems. PhD student /computer networks researcher Columbia University September 2003  \u2013  November 2010  (7 years 3 months) I conducted research in the area of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and large distributed systems. I have vast experience in large-scale system design and implementation as well as algorithmic design and analysis. In the past I worked at Akamai where I designed and built several critical subsystems that support content delivery across thousands of the Akamai servers.  \n \nMy PhD (completed in 2010) research revolved around quality of service in P2P file-sharing networks. As part of my thesis I built, deployed and analyzed large-scale P2P systems, ran experiments on live P2P systems, and studied interaction of controlled P2P agents inside live P2P networks. I designed P2P file-sharing and streaming algorithms that significantly improved performance and fairness of P2P systems and built probabilistic models that described the system behavior.

", "Summary I am a senior software engineer presently employed by Google Inc. in Mountain View, CA. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a double-major in both computer science and biochemistry, where I had the opportunity of working in the confluence of those fields in the area of computational quantum chemistry. During that time as a student I was also employed part-time at the University maintaining the high-performance computer clusters at the Institute for Computer Engineering and Sciences there. After graduation, I joined the DirectX driver team at NVIDIA Corp. and moved to the greater Bay Area of California. 2.5 years later, I moved on to Google, where I am presently situated. \n \nMy interest in computing is making software run fast, which increasingly means distributed computing and massive parallelism. This has many applications, particularly computer graphics (another interest of mine), but it is already an interesting challenge in and of itself. Specialties:Systems software, operating systems, code optimization, Windows driver debugging, Linux systems administration, 3D graphics, C, C++ Summary I am a senior software engineer presently employed by Google Inc. in Mountain View, CA.
