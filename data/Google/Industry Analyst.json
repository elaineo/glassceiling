I am known for my ability to build strong relationships across an organization, which helps me bring together teams to collaborate on large-scale, cross-functional projects.  \n \nIn my free time, I can usually be found feeding, bathing, or shuttling my two young sons to various activities. I love cooking and entertaining, trying new restaurants, and finding new projects to fix up my 100+ year home. When I have time to read, it's typically non-fiction, in a constant effort to understand what makes people tick (\"Switch\" by Chip & Dan Heath, \"Outliers\" by Malcolm Gladwell and \"Freakonomics\" are some favorites).
