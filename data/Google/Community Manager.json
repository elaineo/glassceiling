I use social listening tools such as Conversocial and Crimson Hexagon to better understand how Google's users behave and interact online with our brand and products. All in all, I support about 100M(+) community members and visitors on Google's social products.  \n \nNotable launches: \n- Google Photos app - Google I/O 2015 (4/5 star rating & 100M app installs) \n- Android Lollipop OS - Fall 2014 \n- Nexus 'L' hardware devices - Nexus Player, Nexus 9, Nexus 6 \n- Android Wear wearables (Sony, LG, Samsung, Motorola) - Google I/O 2014 \n \nIn addition, I focus on recruiting and growing our power user base (Top Contributors) within the support communities. I piloted several innovative ways to approach and recruit power users, and I grew the expert base by 5x in just one year (from 7 to 35 experts).  \n \nWith respect to training, I partnered with 60 other community managers and product support managers @Google to create and deliver trainings to 300 Top Contributors.  \n \nOutside of recruiting and training, one of my strengths in building community lies within the realm of expert engagement and management. I attended several in-person meet-ups with experts (including one in London last year) and I hope to continue this in both online and offline settings. Community Manager Google January 2015  \u2013  March 2015  (3 months) San Francisco Bay Area I worked as an accessibility (a11y) community manager in a 20% capacity by delving into Google's external a11y communities: Eyes-Free and Accessible. \n \nI analyzed the type of feedback in the a11y forums and compared it to the type of feedback that our product team receives from users. My ultimate goal was to figure out how to 1). surface a11y top user issues to product more readily and 2). better advocate for users'\u200b a11y needs externally and internally.  \n \nBased on the analysis, I created an internal dashboard and alert system, which Google's centralized a11y engineering team can leverage in product meetings to address feedback, help us close the loop with users and continue improving the overall a11y of Google's products. Account Manager Google August 2011  \u2013  December 2013  (2 years 5 months) Mountain View, CA Google earns a good portion of its revenues from online advertising through AdWords. One of the segments is our mid-market sales team, which balances several million advertisers.  \n \nI was able to work with thousands of clients, indicating the sheer scale of our mid-market team and the depth in which we address each\u2019s clients\u2019 needs. \n \nNotable accomplishments:  \n- Managed a quarterly portfolio of ~300 accounts and drove $4.3M in revenue/quarter \n- Grew my clients\u2019 revenues by +43% QoQ \n- Coordinated creative process and won a customer branding deal valued at $750K/quarter  \n \nIn addition to sales, I volunteer as an internal trainer and sales coach. I facilitate courses to more than 200 Googlers on the subject of personal branding. This course serves as a way to educate others about the topic and help them draft a personal brand statement outlining the qualities and skills that they would like to be known for personally and professionally.
