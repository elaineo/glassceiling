Experience Senior Software Engineer Google April 2015  \u2013 Present (4 months) Greater Chicago Area Senior Software Engineer Google December 2014  \u2013  April 2015  (5 months) Greater New York City Area Continuing to work on Google Apps Script, I became tech lead of the product's backend, leading the team through its largest and most complex product launch to date: add-ons for Google Docs and Google Sheets. \n \nI worked closely with fellow engineers as well as the product management and developer relations organizations to support and improve the existing Apps Script product while brainstorming and helping bring to fruition new features to allow developers to extend Google Apps in new, powerful ways. Software Engineer Google June 2012  \u2013  November 2014  (2 years 6 months) Greater New York City Area After graduating college, I returned to Google as a full-time employee. As during my internship, I'm working on the Google Apps Script team. Developing and maintaining a JavaScript platform allowing consumer and corporate users to access Google services, Apps Script puts users in control of their information and allows easy automation of common business tasks. \n \nInitially, I worked to improve the autocomplete and documentation infrastructure I implemented during my internship, as well as fixing various bugs and implementing new features in Apps Script's JavaScript runtime, helping widen the team's automated testing coverage, and committing miscellaneous bug fixes and new features. Software Engineering Intern Google June 2011  \u2013  September 2011  (4 months) Greater New York City Area The summer before my senior year of college I interned at Google, working on Google Apps Script, a cloud-based JavaScript platform targeting Google Docs and Apps services. I implemented improvements for the script editor's autocomplete implementation, in addition to making bug fixes to various other parts of the project. \n \nMy work consisted primarily of backend changes; however, I also made some minor improvements to the frontend. I spent most of my time programming in Java; additionally, I reported two security holes in a Python-based internal Web application. Co-Op Developer in DIS Division Argonne National Laboratory June 2010  \u2013  September 2010  (4 months) Greater Chicago Area I added new, user-visible features to an in-house charting library, investigated ORM tools for a new project, and documented some existing database access code (JDBC for the frontend and Oracle Pro*C for the backend). Furthermore, I learned basic UML, using diagrams to expose intricate details of excessively complex systems. \n \nDuring my Argonne internship, I gained experience with Oracle and enterprise Java while learning some of the challenges surrounding legacy C code maintenance. I also alerted the full-time staff to a possible license violation regarding an open source CSV parsing library, suggesting possible licensing options and alternative libraries. Web Application Developer North Central College September 2009  \u2013  March 2010  (7 months) Greater Chicago Area While studying at North Central College, I worked part time for several months at their Information Technology Services department, collaborating with full-time Web development staff to completely rewrite the school's online event calendar. The new Web calendar was implemented in PHP with a MySQL backend, making heavy use of the Zend Framework and jQuery libraries to speed development and provide a fluid, intuitive user experience. \n \nHighlights of the new calendar included better support for organizing events, a timeline visualization for the room scheduler, and improved security due to use of the school's Novell LDAP server to authenticate calendar users.
