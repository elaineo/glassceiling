Experience Principal Network Engineer, Consultant, CEO EI Services, LLC April 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 5 months) Maui, Hawaii I am working on private projects and considering fixed contracts within Hawaii (Maui preferred) or remotelyvia VPN (telecommute). \n \nMy strengths start with a strong BGP background; interconnection policy, peering and traffic engineering. I have a strong operations experience, skilled with troubleshooting, debugging and performing network maintenance. I am also skilled with ISIS, OSPF, QoS, in both Cisco and Juniper networks. I've worked with many other vendors at the access layer (eg, DOCSIS, GPON) as well. I am very passionate about Internet technologies and broadband and other service providers. I also have data cabling and data center experience. Senior Network Engineer IntelePeer Cloud Communications Inc March 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 6 months) Greater Denver Area and Maui, Hawaii Network design and administration. Data centers, backbone, peering. \nScaling the network and deploying new services. Network Engineer, Operations & Escalations Google / Google Fiber January 2012  \u2013  March 2014  (2 years 3 months) Mountain View, CA Network Operations Engineer, Google Fiber (AS16591) \n \nGoogle Fiber project. Senior/Lead Operations and Escalations Engineer. \nHelped develop/build the network from the ground up (and work out early bugs in the product). Established NOC processes and protocols, documentation and lead/implement network maintenance. Plenty of on-call. Lots of learning, and lots of sharing what I've learned (and had previously learned). Helped build the team (so many interviews). Worked on all layers of the network, access, core, edge. \n \nI continue to be fortunate; I have been able to observe and learn from some excellent talent over the last 5 years, from Comcast to Google Fiber. \n \nGoogle Fiber is hiring (Engineering and NOC positions) - so if you're looking and are a talented IP professional, you're welcome to message me. Must relocate to Mountain View, CA for these positions. IP Engineer IntelePeer, Inc June 2010  \u2013  January 2012  (1 year 8 months) Denver IntelePeer (AS32385) has been a great opportunity. I am in a very small group and my primary responsibility is to architect/design for the production IP network... to support our voice service and products. I also split my time on operational issues. I attend to all needs of the IP network. We operate a US backbone with 5 peering locations (exchange points / data centers), and I largely focus on most of our BGP design and routing policy. My peer and I manage the office networks too - including their Internet and connectivity to our backbone. In my first year, I've done a lot to improve upon and expand/grow the network. Senior Network Engineer Comcast Cable April 2010  \u2013  June 2010  (3 months) Comcast Media Center (CMC) Network Operations \nThere were two parts to this network, one was general building and office connectivity, but the production/service network was a high-availability network that carried highly critical data and services. The latter was my focus/assignment. This was a small purpose-built network that connected to the backbone and distributed content nationally. The CMC is a major national data center for Comcast, focusing on its video offering. \n \nI wasn't here long, when IntelePeer found me and the opportunity was too good to pass (it was a near perfect match in my skills and their needs). The timing was right. Senior Network Engineer, Backbone Operations Comcast Cable January 2009  \u2013  April 2010  (1 year 4 months) This is an extension/continuation of my \"Network Engineer\" title and description below..... \n \nAs a Senior Engineer (Comcast Backbone, AS 7922), I was the escalation point on high-profile projects, outages and other issues. I was on-call, would work maintenance windows and attend meetings to technically represent our team/desk. I would review, approve and implement network changes/maintenance, as well as author MOP's/write processes and develop configuration templates. I was generally focused/tasked on network audits, BGP peering policy and new peering interconnections/activations. I was 'lead' on our 'SIP peering' (VoIP exchange). I was involved with most/all major BGP related issues or changes, and managed many of our traffic engineering needs. I worked with a small team to create and maintain policy - BGP/routing/peering, QoS and security. \n \nI was highly-skilled and experienced with our design, operation and the associated technologies of the CRAN and backbone networks. Comcast had >25 CRAN's (markets) at peak, but has started to consolidate the networks, each of which would peer with the backbone in a fully-redundant model. The backbone was near Tier1 in size and operation, and growing quite fast commercially. There was also a \"CBONE\" or private backbone to carry specific services between Comcast markets and data centers. Prior to working on the backbone full-time+, I was assigned to as many as 10 different CRAN's also. I believe we were at 20 million cable modem subscribers also. I would work on circuits ranging from T1, GigE, TenGig to 40G/OC768. \n \nI love the Internet and the concept of it... independent networks peering and interconnecting with each other. A GLOBAL system of thousands of interconnected networks, each in theory independent and owned by separate powers and groups or individuals. I enjoy being part of the community, a small piece of the Internet. Network Engineer (Operations) Comcast April 2004  \u2013  December 2008  (4 years 9 months) I started as a \"NOC Analyst,\" quickly moving into a senior role and then into engineering. I am skilled at troubleshooting (investigation & analysis); finding and resolving all types of network problems. I started with the Comcast \"West NOC\" (Denver Tech Center), as they were developing their own platform (moving off of @Home). I was involved with some of the initial/early RAN and WAN designs and deployments, and eventually a full North American IP backbone (almost a Tier1). \n \nI spent a large portion of my early time working overnight, performing network maintenance. That provided a LOT of hands on experience and learning opportunities. This led to doing more complex work and maintenances, promotions and a natural evolution into engineering (also reading lots of books and building an impressive home lab). \n \nI started on the CMTS / DOCSIS edge, but always had a focus and skill on the IP side. Comcast deployed and operated many \"CRAN\" (Converged Regional Area Network) - providing data, voice and video (unicast and multicast) services over a common IP network. Each CRAN has many 'hubs' (data centers), running largely OSPF, ISIS and iBGP (limited RIP on the CMTS), then aggregating to edge routers, which provided (e)BGP connectivity to the Internet (first other ISP's, then the Comcast backbone). I'd work with all types of protocols and network technologies (layer 1-3)... Fiber, Cat5/6, Ethernet, ARP, STP, vlans, 802.1Q, HSRP/VRRP, Multicast, QoS, RIP, OSPF, ISIS, BGP, ACL, VPN, GRE, IPSec, IPv6 and more. I am well-skilled with the design and operation of HA (high-availability) networks. \n \nThe environment was mostly Cisco; I primarily worked with Cisco 6500/7600 and CRS platforms (IOS & IOS-XR). I had some exposure to Juniper MX series and Junos. I have limited MPLS experience, mostly in configuring LDP to establish adjacency and exchange basic label info to establish MPLS pseudowires. Internet Security Specialist Comcast May 2000  \u2013  April 2004  (4 years) I was split between the Network Abuse desk/role and an Internet Security Specialist role in the risk management department. Over the four years in this position, the responsibilities and duties evolved quite significantly. My duties ranged from policy enforcement issues (network abuse: copyright violations, spam, phishing, hijacking, DoS, hacking and incident response) to a few cases of systems forensics (EnCase) and other various cases, some of which required law enforcement interaction (subpoena support, legal orders, etc). I assisted with AUP revisions and separately internal and external network risk assessments/analysis, disaster recovery planning and incident response drills. \n \nIn the 'early days' of network abuse there were a fair amount of legitimate hacking cases that were fun to investigate, in the end viruses/worms/Trojans took over, and Spam was out of control at the time. The Comcast purchase of AT&T Broadband provided what proved out to be a wonderful career opportunity and change - I changed my focus to IP Network operations and engineering. Comcast moved abuse (and security) to the east coast and the function largely became a customer support function. NOC Analyst Comcast Cable November 1998  \u2013  May 2000  (1 year 7 months) I started with MediaOne (which became AT&T Broadband, and then Comcast) while living in Minnesota as a technical support specialist, just as the first (one-way) cable modems were being deployed (beta) in the Twin Cities area. I then moved to the local NOC (/management center) as data and voice services were beginning to be launched. This was an exciting time of growth, both personally, professionally and in the industry. I was a lead IP technician in both the sales/support and NOC roles. In the NOC, we monitored both the HFC (hybrid coax-fiber) plant and IP network.

I would work on circuits ranging from T1, GigE, TenGig to 40G/OC768. \n \nI love the Internet and the concept of it... independent networks peering and interconnecting with each other. A GLOBAL system of thousands of interconnected networks, each in theory independent and owned by separate powers and groups or individuals. I enjoy being part of the community, a small piece of the Internet. Senior Network Engineer, Backbone Operations Comcast Cable January 2009  \u2013  April 2010  (1 year 4 months) This is an extension/continuation of my \"Network Engineer\" title and description below..... \n \nAs a Senior Engineer (Comcast Backbone, AS 7922), I was the escalation point on high-profile projects, outages and other issues. I was on-call, would work maintenance windows and attend meetings to technically represent our team/desk. I would review, approve and implement network changes/maintenance, as well as author MOP's/write processes and develop configuration templates. I was generally focused/tasked on network audits, BGP peering policy and new peering interconnections/activations. I was 'lead' on our 'SIP peering' (VoIP exchange). I was involved with most/all major BGP related issues or changes, and managed many of our traffic engineering needs. I worked with a small team to create and maintain policy - BGP/routing/peering, QoS and security. \n \nI was highly-skilled and experienced with our design, operation and the associated technologies of the CRAN and backbone networks. Comcast had >25 CRAN's (markets) at peak, but has started to consolidate the networks, each of which would peer with the backbone in a fully-redundant model. The backbone was near Tier1 in size and operation, and growing quite fast commercially. There was also a \"CBONE\" or private backbone to carry specific services between Comcast markets and data centers. Prior to working on the backbone full-time+, I was assigned to as many as 10 different CRAN's also. I believe we were at 20 million cable modem subscribers also.

I enjoy being part of the community, a small piece of the Internet. Network Engineer (Operations) Comcast April 2004  \u2013  December 2008  (4 years 9 months) I started as a \"NOC Analyst,\" quickly moving into a senior role and then into engineering. I am skilled at troubleshooting (investigation & analysis); finding and resolving all types of network problems. I started with the Comcast \"West NOC\" (Denver Tech Center), as they were developing their own platform (moving off of @Home). I was involved with some of the initial/early RAN and WAN designs and deployments, and eventually a full North American IP backbone (almost a Tier1). \n \nI spent a large portion of my early time working overnight, performing network maintenance. That provided a LOT of hands on experience and learning opportunities. This led to doing more complex work and maintenances, promotions and a natural evolution into engineering (also reading lots of books and building an impressive home lab). \n \nI started on the CMTS / DOCSIS edge, but always had a focus and skill on the IP side. Comcast deployed and operated many \"CRAN\" (Converged Regional Area Network) - providing data, voice and video (unicast and multicast) services over a common IP network. Each CRAN has many 'hubs' (data centers), running largely OSPF, ISIS and iBGP (limited RIP on the CMTS), then aggregating to edge routers, which provided (e)BGP connectivity to the Internet (first other ISP's, then the Comcast backbone). I'd work with all types of protocols and network technologies (layer 1-3)... Fiber, Cat5/6, Ethernet, ARP, STP, vlans, 802.1Q, HSRP/VRRP, Multicast, QoS, RIP, OSPF, ISIS, BGP, ACL, VPN, GRE, IPSec, IPv6 and more. I am well-skilled with the design and operation of HA (high-availability) networks. \n \nThe environment was mostly Cisco; I primarily worked with Cisco 6500/7600 and CRS platforms (IOS & IOS-XR). I had some exposure to Juniper MX series and Junos. I have limited MPLS experience, mostly in configuring LDP to establish adjacency and exchange basic label info to establish MPLS pseudowires.

Internet Security Specialist Comcast May 2000  \u2013  April 2004  (4 years) I was split between the Network Abuse desk/role and an Internet Security Specialist role in the risk management department. Over the four years in this position, the responsibilities and duties evolved quite significantly. My duties ranged from policy enforcement issues (network abuse: copyright violations, spam, phishing, hijacking, DoS, hacking and incident response) to a few cases of systems forensics (EnCase) and other various cases, some of which required law enforcement interaction (subpoena support, legal orders, etc). I assisted with AUP revisions and separately internal and external network risk assessments/analysis, disaster recovery planning and incident response drills. \n \nIn the 'early days' of network abuse there were a fair amount of legitimate hacking cases that were fun to investigate, in the end viruses/worms/Trojans took over, and Spam was out of control at the time. The Comcast purchase of AT&T Broadband provided what proved out to be a wonderful career opportunity and change - I changed my focus to IP Network operations and engineering. Comcast moved abuse (and security) to the east coast and the function largely became a customer support function.

NOC Analyst Comcast Cable November 1998  \u2013  May 2000  (1 year 7 months) I started with MediaOne (which became AT&T Broadband, and then Comcast) while living in Minnesota as a technical support specialist, just as the first (one-way) cable modems were being deployed (beta) in the Twin Cities area. I then moved to the local NOC (/management center) as data and voice services were beginning to be launched. This was an exciting time of growth, both personally, professionally and in the industry. I was a lead IP technician in both the sales/support and NOC roles. In the NOC, we monitored both the HFC (hybrid coax-fiber) plant and IP network.
