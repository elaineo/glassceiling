Sales Operations Manager Google June 2003  \u2013  March 2006  (2 years 10 months) New York, NY I started my career at pre-IPO Google as a contractor, hired to help our ad sales team automate its internal systems, standardize practices and contract administration across disconnected offices, and document internal process controls for SOX compliance. I became a Google employee in Tim Armstrong's Direct Sales organization (DSO), as a Process and Compliance Specialist in the Sales Finance organization. After the IPO, I took on increasingly senior roles in more complex projects, creating multiple >$100M sales channels for Google ads products. I developed expertise entering new markets with novel sales and customer-support approaches, creating large teams with scaleable internal systems during hypergrowth periods; and during this time I was promoted twice.  \n \nIn general, my specialty is semi-automation, combining human \"brute force\" approaches with Google's unique engineering and infrastructure resources.
