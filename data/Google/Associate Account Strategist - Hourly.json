View Deki - Change a life with a loan Edit Communications Assistant (intern) Deki January 2014  \u2013  June 2014  (6 months) Bristol, United Kingdom I was Communications Assistant at Deki, which provides micro-loans for people in the developing countries. I was responsible for all aspects of the communications in order to boost the amount of lenders needed to support enterprises in the developing world and establish better relationships with our partners in the field. I was heavily involved in overseeing and managing various social media channels that we use such as Facebook, Twitter and Youtube. I was also communicated with internal and external stakeholders to build better relationships and drive the amount of lenders on our database. I believe this experience has made me understand about various marketing principles and how to use marketing channels in order to achieve objectives of the organisation.
