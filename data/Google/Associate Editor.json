and social strategies, issues management, writing and content strategy. \n \nI am currently head of the global technology practice at APCO Worldwide, an independent, global communications, stakeholder engagement and business strategy firm. \n \nExcelling in managing large, complex clients with significant business and communications challenges, I lead teams on accounts in sectors spanning mobile/wireless, IT services, big data and more, driving corporate, product and stakeholder communications.  \n \nPrior to APCO, I led Text100 North America for five years, navigating the region through the global economic crisis, driving unprecedented stability that included the retention of all top clients and restoring growth each of the last three years, including a period of over 20% growth. \n \nI previously ran the agency's New York office, helping to greatly expand its client roster and establishing it as a flagship office. I joined Text100 to lead the IBM account, which I supervised in the US and globally, driving greater collaboration, creating and training teams on new methodologies and ensuring quality service across 15 markets. \n \nPrior to Text100, I led the NY technology practice for MSL, leading a high performance team on a large portfolio of tech clients, but also collaborating across the corporate, consumer and healthcare practices, as well as driving many of the agency's branding engagements. \n \nBefore joining the dark side I was a journalist at CMP Publications, where I wrote for InformationWeek and Open Systems Today.

This also empowered fundraisers with the ability to more accurately prioritize prospect pools. Implemented a regular Prospect Review Meeting (PRM) to discuss capacity, connections, and prospect assignments from names identified in the weekly gift log. I acquired a database screening tool (Donorscape) which better empowered the team to proactively uncover prospects with high affinity; created a pipeline of high net worth individuals which helped to update prospect records more frequently than was previously practiced. Lastly, I trained my team on how to manage their relationships with fundraisers; providing better customer service; which helped to re-brand the research department within Global Resources (development).
