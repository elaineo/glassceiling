Experience Mobile App Search & Indexing - Engineering Manager, Tech Lead, Staff Software Engineer Google July 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 2 months) Mountain View, CA Manage a team to index, understand, and serve the content in mobile apps. Social Graph Service - Staff Software Engineer, Tech Lead Google January 2012  \u2013  July 2014  (2 years 7 months) Mountain View, CA - The Social Graph Service provides a unified data model and API over all social graph data at Google. It is the central place for reading/writing membership data of G+ Circles, Hangout, G+ Communities, G+ Events and Google Voice, and reading user profiles. The service is a core component of several Google services including Google Plus, Hangout, and Google Voice. \n- As the Tech Lead of the Social Graph Core team, led a team of 5 engineers to develop the main system in Java on top of Spanner storage and ST index, and managed collaboration with clients to support new products and use cases. \n- Drove the design and implementation of the system for scalability (10+B user membership edges and 1M queries/second across 15 data centers), performance (under 12ms mean latency), consistency and client integration (70+ clients). \n- Personally wrote most of the system's backend serving layer and indexing solution. \n- Drove the migration of the system's storage from Megastore to Spanner, in the process significantly increasing the system's scalability (from 100 writes/seconds to 30+K writes/second) and consistency (full serializability). Completed the migration with zero system down-time or change to clients. \n- Led the launch of Hangout, G+ Communities and G+ Vanity URLs on Social Graph Service. Designed and implemented end-to-end indexing solution on top of ST index to support fast group chat lookup and various sorted views in Hangout client. Optimized the system's serving logic to reduce machine usage by 3X. Google Play Music - Senior Software Engineer, Tech Lead, Architect Google November 2007  \u2013  January 2012  (4 years 3 months) Mountain View, CA - The Metadata Management Service handles the storage, relationship management, retrieval, and matching of 30+M tracks and the associated metadata. It aggregates the artist, album and track metadata from hundreds of music labels, and manages the complex relationship in the data. It facilitates the matching of all ingested music content, and powers core functionalities such as music search, Scan-and-Match of user uploaded content, and recommendations. \n- Architected the system end-to-end. Personally wrote the first version of the system in C++ on top of Bigtable storage. \n- Engineered end-to-end metadata matching system that matches raw content from music labels and user uploads to existing music store records. The system supports the re-ingestion and matching of the entire music corpus in under a day, and instant update of newly ingested content in under 2 hours. \n \n- The Music Store Service powers the search and browsing experience in the Google Play music store, and is the central business server for music search results, purchase fulfillment, manually curated content, and customer reviews. It serves 20+K queries/second, 100+K orders and $300+K revenue per day. \n- Built the service in Java on top of ST index (search results), Zipit (reviews), and Checkout (orders). \n \n- Led a team of 6 to develop the frontend service in Java and client music player in JavaScript. Drove product features and designs with product managers and UI designers. Web Suggest - Software Engineer III, Tech Lead Google September 2006  \u2013  November 2007  (1 year 3 months) Mountain View, CA - Web Suggest is the feature that completes your query as you type in the search box.

Drove the launch of the product in Asian markets (China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong). Achieved 25% feature adoption, increased average query length by 2%, and saved adopted users 48% keystrokes. \n- Using a Bayesian bigram model trained with query data in web logs, built the Chinese pinyin suggest feature that enabled Chinese users to input pinyin and get a list of matched Chinese character query completions. This greatly improved the search experience of Chinese users, allowing them to perform searches even when they do not have IME installed. Web Search - Software Engineer II Google October 2005  \u2013  September 2006  (1 year) Mountain View, CA - Built using Python the Continuous Quality Evaluation Pipeline for CJK language segmenter to generate quality evaluation runs for quality experiments, and aggregate evaluation results. This enabled the evaluation, optimization, and ultimately the launch of Google's in-house CJK language segmenter that replaced the buggy and black-box third-party segmentation software we were using. \n- Implemented various web search frontend features including search query language encoding detection, and safesearch and results ranking twiddling for CJK queries. Software Engineer Intern Amazon, Epson, Redknee, and ATI (now AMD) 2000  \u2013  2004  (4 years) Various - At Amazon, developed Guaranteed Pub/sub Messaging Framework for Order Management Systems using C++, CORBA, and Oracle AQ. Implemented Fast Track Shipping for 1-Click customers using Perl, Mason, C++ and JavaScript. \n- At Epson, re-designed the printing algorithm of the Webprint client Windows application using Java, C++ and JNI, resulting in significant enhancements to application performance and printing quality. Designed and implemented printing app for Symbian OS using C++, Symbian SDK, and SPP. \n- At Redknee, built CTP (Card Telephony Protocol) Simulation System using Java and SQL. \n- At ATI (now AMD), developed 2D Graphics automation test suites using C++, GDI, Windows SDK, and Visual Test.
