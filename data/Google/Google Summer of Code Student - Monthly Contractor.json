It is an interdisciplinary field with applications in Mathematics, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics and Philosophy. Correspondence theory, which is the topic of my PhD project, aims at answering how formal languages in logic interact and overlap in their shared semantic environment. A major part of my project has been dedicated to designing algorithms to compare modal logic with first-order logic, using algebraic techniques. Correspondence theory has applications in both Database theory for query answering and automated theorem proving. During my PhD I have published research articles in peer-reviewed journals, given presentations in international conferences, and also have been involved in teaching master courses.
