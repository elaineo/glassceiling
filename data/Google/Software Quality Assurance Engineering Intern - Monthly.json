", "Summary Ever tried telling a computer to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? If you have, you will realize that computers aren\u2019t really smart. They are extremely fast at processing data, but lack human logic that we humans take for granted. The step-by-step process in making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich can be a vigorous challenge if the directions aren't thoroughly detailed. As a Java programmer and Computer Science student studying at San Jose State University, I am learning what it takes to become a full time programmer and to acquire future internships. \n \nI am currently enhancing my programming skills with HTML5, CSS, PHP, Database Management Systems, and improving on my Python skills by visiting websites such as CodeAcademy.com and CodingBat.com. I describe myself as a hard worker and try to succeed with every task given to me. I enjoy the thrill of solving a programming assignment even if it takes me a substantial amount of time. Working through my assignments has made me appreciate the programmers who develop video games, graphics, and simple objects such as an analog clock. These programs are not simple tasks and require logic, determination, testing, and time for these programs to operate successfully. I have dedicated a vast amount of time needed to work on my assignments and will continue to use my organization and determination skills to get the job done. \n \nWhen I worked for McKesson Specialty Health as the QA Engineer Intern, I was assigned the task to draft and execute test plans for their Lynx Mobile product and certify builds ready for release for their Onmark product. I took the initiative to ask for assistance from the QA team whenever I had a question about the functionality of the product. Throughout my summer internship, I was able to grasp how the corporate workplace was like and refine my business communication skills. \n \nSpecialities: Java, C, HTML5, SCRUM, Microsoft Office, Data Structures, Netbeans, Eclipse, Customer Service.
