Experience Software Engineering Intern, PhD Google May 2014  \u2013  August 2014  (4 months) Mountain View, CA I worked on Street View for my summer internship at Google. My project involved predicting the best place to look in panoramas. I used computer vision and machine learning techniques to build a set of classes to solve the problem. The project was really perfect for me, since I love computer vision, machine learning, maps, and photography. It also fit very well with my doctoral research which involves predicting where people look in images. \n \nMost of my work was done in C++ and I made use of many internal Google technologies. For example, I used MapReduce to distribute work on large datasets and Bigtable to cache results. I also used JavaScript to build an interactive demo of my product. In the end, I had a multithreaded production-ready product. \n \nThere were plenty of other opportunities I was able to take advantage of at Google. I filed a patent, found and fixed bugs in other products, and provided feedback on unreleased products. I also met many people that inspired and encouraged me. I definitely learned a lot about writing high-quality tested code to work at scale. Software Development Intern Lithium Technologies June 2013  \u2013  August 2013  (3 months) San Francisco, CA My primary responsibility over the summer was to refactor a customer-facing feature to fix bugs, improve security, and better organize the code. I had to go down many paths before finally finding the best solution, but in the end, I was proud of the work that went in the release. Along the way, I learned a lot about agile development, testing, and the varied responsibilities of a software developer. \n \nThanks to the well-designed intern program at Lithium, I also discovered other roles in the company. I had the opportunity to mock up some UX designs for a scalable multi-phase web staging back end, then present iterations to the UX team for feedback. I regularly interacted with different team members to get their perspective, and I met executives from Engineering, Human Resources, and Marketing. I even made a sales pitch video that was shown in front of the entire international sales staff! \n \nFurthermore, getting to live in San Francisco was an eye opening experience. I gained new perspectives by attending talks, meetups, and by visiting colleagues at other companies. The coffee wasn't half bad, either! It's hard to believe how much I learned in just under two months.

My research projects fall under the categories of improving password-based authentication and providing simple-to-use secure online communications. I am especially interested in research that address the concerns of not only security experts, but also businesses and users, as I feel this is necessary for any research to reach widespread deployment. \n \nI have previously worked at a start-up (Computer Lab Solutions) and Brigham Young University developing lab management technologies deployed to hundreds of universities. Additionally, I have successfully completed internships with Microsoft, Microsoft Research, Google, and Blue Coat Systems. \n \nMore about my published research can be found at http://isrl.byu.edu/researchers/scott-ruoti/ Experience PhD Intern Sandia National Laboratories December 2014  \u2013 Present (9 months) Research Assistant Brigham Young University - Internet Security Research Lab September 2009  \u2013 Present (6 years) \u2022\tAssisted in the writing of all papers submitted by the lab \n\u2022\tResearched and built a system for secure web-based email \n\u2022\tConducted user studies verifying the security and usability of the above system \n\u2022\tCreated formal proofs of the Secure Remote Password protocol and designed elliptic curve variants. \n\u2022\tCo-authored several NSF grant proposal that cover multiple security topics \n\u2022\tConducting research into security usability, phishing, strong password-protocols, safe password entry, single sign-on and hacking \n\u2022\tMeasured and analyzed the prevalence of TLS proxies (SSL inspection) \n\u2022\tLeveraged Mechanical Turks to rapidly gain user data \n\u2022\tMentored undergraduates and Master degree students Research Intern Blue Coat Systems April 2014  \u2013  August 2014  (5 months) Draper, UT \u2022\tLead research into classify internet IP ranges according to usage patterns \n\u2022\tDeveloped system allowing threat analysts to quickly ascertain the trustworthiness of a source IP \n\u2022\tIntegrated research with existing machine learning systems allowing automatic classification of new traffic and detection of anomalous activity PhD Software Engineering Intern Google May 2013  \u2013  August 2013  (4 months) Mountain View, CA \u2022\tLed design and development of an enterprise-scale authentication technology \n\u2022\tDesigned a third party API and associated libraries \n\u2022\tAssisted in design and discussion of currently deployed Google authentication technologies \n\u2022\tMy work is currently in preparation for usability study and possible patent Research Intern Microsoft Research May 2012  \u2013  August 2012  (4 months) Redmond, WA \u2022\tResearched topics including unsupervised learning in facial recognition and social search \n\u2022\tLeveraged third-party authentication protocols \n\u2022\tDeveloped a mobile application based on the research \n\u2022\tMy research is currently in the process of being prepared for patent submission Software Development Engineer Intern Microsoft May 2010  \u2013  July 2010  (3 months) Redmond, WA \u2022\tDeveloped software to consume OData feeds and display cross-platform KPIs in Silverlight \n\u2022\tParticipated in cross-team and cross-discipline planning meetings for Office 2013 Software Development Engineer Intern Microsoft May 2009  \u2013  July 2010  (1 year 3 months) Redmond, WA \u2022\tResearched free-form ontological model detection and merging in Excel and other office products \n\u2022\tDeveloped prototype tool to search disparate excel spreadsheets and automatically combine all the information into a single source.
