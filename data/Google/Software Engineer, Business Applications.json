This application consisted primarily of a framework allowing other developers to build specific modules, such as traffic tickets and personal arrest history. I personally designed and wrote a number of the core systems including the following. The user validation system used COM objects on the application server to validate user login requests against the Windows domain. The centralized configuration management system allowed the administrator to configure multiple environments for the users to access, specifying application servers, database servers and specific databases to be used for the session, allowing the user to login to multiple production or training configurations. This also allowed assigning connection to different related services for each configuration. The security permissions systems enabled the Administrator to build both complex and simple security groups and assign users to these groups. I then integrated this information in to the data access and data update, screen controls, menus and user controls to respect the various permissions granted. The address validation system took existing Geographical data and parsed user input addresses, this system was capable of validating and providing latitude and longitude for buildings, intersections and commonly named locations.

This web site allows agents in the field to build pricing sheet, get claims status information, monthly report files and other necessary documents. An emphasis was placed on ensuring the security of the information and on-time project completion. I personally generated the project plan for the web project from the time of my joining the team to the completion of the project.

This application consisted primarily of a framework allowing other developers to build specific modules, such as traffic tickets and personal arrest history. I personally designed and wrote a number of the core systems including the following. The user validation system used COM objects on the application server to validate user login requests against the Windows domain. The centralized configuration management system allowed the administrator to configure multiple environments for the users to access, specifying application servers, database servers and specific databases to be used for the session, allowing the user to login to multiple production or training configurations. This also allowed assigning connection to different related services for each configuration. The security permissions systems enabled the Administrator to build both complex and simple security groups and assign users to these groups. I then integrated this information in to the data access and data update, screen controls, menus and user controls to respect the various permissions granted. The address validation system took existing Geographical data and parsed user input addresses, this system was capable of validating and providing latitude and longitude for buildings, intersections and commonly named locations.
