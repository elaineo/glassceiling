Staff Software Engineer Google July 2012  \u2013  January 2014  (1 year 7 months) Google[x] I worked on the applications you see when you use Google Glass, specifically real time video calls. This was all Android app work, with JNI and some lower level work in addition to the app itself. Senior Software Engineer Google August 2010  \u2013  July 2012  (2 years) I worked on several projects here at YouTube, centered around the delivery of real-time video to consumers. I helped build the platform that streamed the 2012 London Olympics, and Hangouts on Air. This was a combination of Java and Python, generally as RPC services. Software Engineer Google October 2007  \u2013  August 2010  (2 years 11 months) I worked on Google Groups, a small (by Google standards) but stable mailing list product. Got it to work for enterprise customers, helped build legal discovery tools, etc. Did a lot of operational improvements on it so that it didn't require as many engineers to keep it running. Maintenance work in C++ and python, new features developed in Java.

It involved J2EE and message-driven beans before that was thing. Company had problems because message board articles tend to be posted by crazy people. All Java. On Sun hardware, even. Software Engineer New.net, Inc. 2001  \u2013  2001  (less than a year) Let's be honest. Nobody but the employees remember this place. But, basically, they got it into their heads to create a DNS registrar that would handle top-level domains without the necessary standards-body approval, so you could buy \"jones.family\", and create a website for http://jones.family, but it could only be seen on the 20 or 30 computers that had some crazy browser plugin installed. \n \nShortly after I left, that \"browser plugin\" started to do things like change your search engine, and is now widely considered to be spyware. \"Senior\" Server Engineer eMachines May 1999  \u2013  December 2000  (1 year 8 months) Built a targeting popup ad server, an OOBE for Windows ME, an ad traffic system, and a bunch of other weird stuff. Emachines is still around in some form, but the division I worked for has long since evaporated. bottlewasher and haggler Free-PC/eMachines 1999  \u2013  2000  (1 year) Mostly worked on MySQL databases designed with huge schemas, rather than taking a normalized approach and letting MySQL do its thing. \n Portfolio Engineer First Quadrant 1997  \u2013  1999  (2 years) Perl, lots and lots of perl.

Deployed as a collection of services behind a Web UI, the platform features model hosting, training, online and batch scoring, evaluation, and introspection, and supports binary\u00ad and multi\u00adclassification models, and ranking models. The platform is used by several teams, and it is closely integrated with several production workflows. I have designed the system, and implemented one of the services (a training service). I have managed the project using Agile methods. I have lead collaborations with user and partner teams, in Mountain View and New York. \n Staff Software Engineer, People Manager Google 2012  \u2013  2013  (1 year) Krak\u00f3w, Poland Managed an organization of 22 engineers, focused on advertiser acquisition. The org has built a range of tools and systems, from support systems used by Marketing & Sales, to prediction services, to handling promotional AdWords coupons. \n \nThe latter is an externally\u00ad facing service that handles redemption and fulfillment tracking of coupons, and it has been key in driving advertiser acquisition. I have co-\u00adauthored initial system designs, and later, managed the team in building and launching the system.
