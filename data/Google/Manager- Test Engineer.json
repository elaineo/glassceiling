I have a passion for understanding how things work and thus have interests spanning multiple domains. Currently, this set includes: natural language processing, test tool development and learning the complete works of Dvorak for solo piano (a long term goal to be sure). I'm interested in any software development role, development or test, where I would be challenged to make a product or service more awesome for the customer and where my ideas will be heard and valued for their merit regardless of my level.

Experience Test Engineer II - Corporate Engineering Google September 2013  \u2013 Present (1 year 11 months) Mountain View, CA Corporate Engineering is the division tasked with empowering Google employees with world leading technology, from managing data centers to building business applications to providing tech support. My specific role thus far has been to provide test support for Google's payroll and compensation applications through the development of test plans and scenario automation via WebDriver and Protractor. Additionally, I provide a test oriented perspective during the product planning phase, focusing on issues related to both testability (for a more stable release) and usability (for the consumer). Test Engineer II - Android Google July 2011  \u2013  September 2013  (2 years 3 months) Mountain View, CA My work on the Android OS spanned from Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) to Android 4.4 (KitKat). In that time, I primarily focused on testing the media framework, building out existing test automation and infrastructure as well as providing failure investigative support, before shifting to the Google camera application where I brought a similar level of support. From the Nexus 4 onward, I also assisted in camera tuning of all Nexus devices, generating image quality reports qualitatively assessing several metrics (oversharpening, distortion, chromatic aberration, color accuracy, etc.) which helped guide camera tuning decisions. Software Development Engineer in Test Microsoft September 2008  \u2013  July 2011  (2 years 11 months) Redmond, WA During the Office 2010 development cycle, I was the integration test owner for the Natural Language Group. We develop several proofing tools and I worked with our partner teams within Office to ensure their proper and seamless integration. Externally, my responsibilities included driving cross group test efforts to achieve a healthy level of test coverage as well as serving as a primary point of contact for test failures and bug investigations. I worked closely with our partners in Dublin and on occassion managed our contingent staff in Beijing during milestone test passes. Internally, I wrote UI automation libraries and used them to implement most of our application level test cases. I also coordinated manual test passes and helped our linguistic testers implement their end-to-end scenarios. \n \nFor the Office15 cycle, I developed an email anonymization tool that allowed us to build up a corpora of sanitized emails which our linguistic components could then train against. I also wrote UI automation libraries for my team as well as automation against Outlook, PowerPoint and OneNote for the new features we added to the Office suite.

MTNL has around six line of Business for which there will be single convergent billing to the subscriber. This configuration fo convergent billing will enable subscriber to get a single invoice or bill for any number of servicers taken from MTNL, unlike earlier each service use to have separate bill ex. If a subscriber has taken GSM and Lese line service from MTNL then, MTNL would generate two separate bills for the subscriber, but this CB will enable the subscriber to pay on a single bill both the charges of the service which he has taken. \n \nResponsibilities: \nCoordinated with business development team and worked as Business Analyst to understand MTNL's requirement. \nAs a Business Analyst I was responsible for analyzing the requirements and preparing the system requirement specification.  \nPreparing High level document LOB wise.
