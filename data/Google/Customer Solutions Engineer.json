Experience Product Manager Google January 2012  \u2013 Present (3 years 8 months) London, United Kingdom My new role title reflects a slight change in focus from when I was a Technical Programme Manager: although before I was responsible for the products I have, this new role more firmly moves into the Product Management sphere, moving away from day to day technical delivery and having more time for more strategic product lifecycle concerns: adoption, ROI, user feedback, but keeping user experience, stakeholder management, release management, PRD and feature prioritisation I did before. Technical Programme Manager Google April 2011  \u2013  December 2011  (9 months) I manage a portfolio of internal products for Google's huge global sales force.

Technical Project Manager ATG March 2002  \u2013  November 2002  (9 months) ATG and Sun worked with Telefonica to build their PDSL platform in 2002. It was a pretty wizzy system which offered things like video game rental, videoconferencing, etc. The ATG team were sharp and I was able to contribute to the code base at one point to work with order processing and suchlike; but by and large my job was to help keep the project focused and on-track. It was chaotic; Telefonica aren't much fun to work with.

Flush with cash these guys rapidly grew to have 1800 people in 32 plush offices worldwide (their SF offices cost $US60k/month, $1m to set up and they committed to a 10 year lease). But there wasn't a lot of substance to their strategy and when times got rough, it imploded.  \n \nSo my stint in their Barcelona office was interesting. I certainly learnt a lot about how not to manage an office by the MD there, and some insight into what the CTO role involves. I wasn't really ready for that role to be honest; but it was the first step in my move away from 'pure tech' to a leadership track. I had a team of 16 people -- some of whom didn't speak English, and I focused on team career development, selling & educating technology to clients, and process improvement. I had a desk on the 28th floor of a building in Barcelona where I could see the beach below. It was nice. I had fun; it was never going to last.

We worked with Java and sold user experience services (e.g. breakfast presentation to New Zealand Computer Society: 'usability, the next competitive advantage') -- both somewhat ahead of our time, particularly in New Zealand. Research programmer University of Auckland 1993  \u2013  1997  (4 years) This was a Mac / Unix environment. My career highlights from this age was to write a portable communications library, 'platform independent packets' which was source-compatible with Mac front end clients (8Mhz Mac SEs mostly!) and our Digital Unix back ends. Through some 4-byte char hacks I managed to get code that would send binary-compatible data even though the front end was big endian and the back end was little-endian. [Learn more on endianness: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness] \n \nI rewrote the Computer Science Department's resource management suite: machine bookings, printing, and internet data usage, the latter is when students had to pay for internet traffic. The latter, 'Net Guardian', was then rolled out across the University of Auckland, renamed 'Net Account'. \n \nMac GUIs were very sophisticated for the time, based on a GUI library I cowrote with a friend of mine, Richard Knuckey. We called it The Screen Manager and it should've rocked the world, but we got hung up on commercial issues.

My career highlights from this age was to write a portable communications library, 'platform independent packets' which was source-compatible with Mac front end clients (8Mhz Mac SEs mostly!) and our Digital Unix back ends. Through some 4-byte char hacks I managed to get code that would send binary-compatible data even though the front end was big endian and the back end was little-endian. [Learn more on endianness: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness] \n \nI rewrote the Computer Science Department's resource management suite: machine bookings, printing, and internet data usage, the latter is when students had to pay for internet traffic. The latter, 'Net Guardian', was then rolled out across the University of Auckland, renamed 'Net Account'. \n \nMac GUIs were very sophisticated for the time, based on a GUI library I cowrote with a friend of mine, Richard Knuckey. We called it The Screen Manager and it should've rocked the world, but we got hung up on commercial issues.
