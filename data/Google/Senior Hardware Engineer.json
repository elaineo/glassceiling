Experience in digital circuit design, FPGA emulation, computer architecture, non-volatile memory-based storage architectures, and embedded systems. \n \nWhile at UCSD, my research interests focused on the hardware/software co-design of scalable systems for solving large-scale, data-intensive applications. With that goal, my research targeted two possible architectural solutions. The first solution was to build storage devices that leverage -- in both the hardware and software layers -- the potential of emerging non-volatile memories. The second solution was to design and build an FPGA-based cluster that supports highly-threaded processing elements, a low-latency interconnect, and tightly-coupled access to large amounts of memory.
