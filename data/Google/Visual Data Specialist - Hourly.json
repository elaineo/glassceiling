I've taken this opportunity to hone my proficiency with digital cartographic systems, spreadsheets, presentations, and documents in the field of computer technology. I take self-education very seriously and endeavor to increase my understanding of internal systems, data management, and coding every day. \n \n \nI am a Geology graduate of Western Washington University (WWU), where my undergraduate research involved XRD, SEM-EDAX, and thin-section analysis of clay minerals and alteration mineralization in rock cores from the Kilgore mine of Idaho. I presented my thesis to a panel of my peers and instructors in March, 2012.  \n \nJust before starting this research, I completed field mapping as a part of WWU's geology field camp in Oregon, Idaho, and Montana during the summer of 2011. This involved six weeks of highly-involved projects to teach and improve field methodology and geologic understanding. \n \nPrior to engagement with Geology, I worked with register systems, customer service, and horticulture. This included providing information and troubleshooting for various garden issues. \n \nI pride myself in my technical skills as well, having learned several types of welding and steel work, minor computer troubleshooting, minor woodworking, ARC GIS mapping, landscaping and maintenance, and several specialized skills regarding computer software.  \n \nSpecialties: X-ray diffraction sample analysis, SEM analysis, Transmitted light microscopy, spatial data organization, spatial database troubleshooting, horticultural applications and troubleshooting, data and monetary database use, steel Arc and Mig welding, steel oxy-acetylene welding, landscaping and maintenance Summary Currently serving to detect and troubleshoot data problems for Google Maps, as well as carry out metrics reporting, training, documentation, and team management tasks.

I have worked in many settings: factories, sales (in person, phone and retail), all sorts of jobs in restaurants (sever, bartender, host, cook, bus boy, dishwasher, etcetera), lab assistant, janitor, and until 2011 worked for United States Postal Service as both a mail carrier and a clerk, then I went on to spend two years working for Google maps. My varied job experience gives me insight into the way many different types of businesses work and allows me to apply innovative ideas to diverse situations. \n \nIn December of 2010, I graduated from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh with a Bachelor of Science degree in Geography with a global insights emphasis. My courses included various disciplines, such as urban planning and sustainability, besides the cartography, biodiversity and math and science classes you would expect. Some of my strengths include: math skills, interpreting and analyzing information and researching to develop advanced ideas for presentation. This can be seen in my class work, such as papers (for example I\u2019ve done both research papers and executive summaries) and projects, which are available upon your request. Additionally, in college today, group work is emphasized. Often times, being the oldest in the group and often in the class, I had to take the reins and lead the group. In many cases, I would make certain our group completed the task well and on time.  \n \nMy geography degree has taught me to consider all sorts of data and information and compare, combine and reconfigure it into actionable, useable presentations or reports. Of course, my degree work also included the spatial and map skills most people think of when they hear geography. Furthermore, my coursework involved making presentations, including maps, power point presentations, research papers, charts, graphs, and poster presentations.
