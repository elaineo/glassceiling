The pillars of my working style are technical mastery, adaptive creativity, and making things elegant. As a lead at Google Maps, I help manage a team of 20 data specialists by providing training and guidance with tool usage and debugging, as well as knowing and interpreting policy. I keep close contact with management, HR, and other leads to ensure that communication of goals and expectations flows smoothly. I also keep track of the documentation, personnel, and progress of a constantly changing queue of projects ranging from sweet and simple to bizarre and dynamic.  \n \nThe management and mentors I've had the pleasure of encountering at Google Maps have made it easy for me to do my best at work and to enjoy my job. Everyone deserves that opportunity, and I prioritize reaching out to my coworkers to make sure they're confident with the processes and tools, and that they feel safe and valued in their workplace.  \n \nMy interests include but are not limited to project documentation, workflow development, skincare, nanomaterials, ceramic engineering, hiking and backpacking, medium format film photography, and a budding obsession with fantasy football. If you would like to connect with me regarding any, all, or none of those things, please reach out! I am not currently looking for a job, but I would love to make new professional acquaintances and renew/maintain contact with people already in my network.

I keep close contact with management, HR, and other leads to ensure that communication of goals and expectations flows smoothly. I also keep track of the documentation, personnel, and progress of a constantly changing queue of projects ranging from sweet and simple to bizarre and dynamic.  \n \nThe management and mentors I've had the pleasure of encountering at Google Maps have made it easy for me to do my best at work and to enjoy my job. Everyone deserves that opportunity, and I prioritize reaching out to my coworkers to make sure they're confident with the processes and tools, and that they feel safe and valued in their workplace.  \n \nMy interests include but are not limited to project documentation, workflow development, skincare, nanomaterials, ceramic engineering, hiking and backpacking, medium format film photography, and a budding obsession with fantasy football. If you would like to connect with me regarding any, all, or none of those things, please reach out! I am not currently looking for a job, but I would love to make new professional acquaintances and renew/maintain contact with people already in my network.
