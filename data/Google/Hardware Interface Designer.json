The design has the goal of providing more relevant information to users, while at the same time making the map clearer and visually easier to read. We refined the visual language used to present multi-faceted information on the map, and also defined the typography, colors, iconography, and line elements to reflect the needs of both local and international users IF communication Design Award 2005 - Website for MaLiLian Furniture IF Design Germany September 2005 http://exhibition.ifdesign.de/entrydetails_en.html?beitrag_id=21439 \n \nObjective: MaLiLian one-off furniture is positioned as \u201cArt for Living\u201d and caters to a global cosmopolitan clientele. Therefore, the company\u2019s \u201ccatalogue\u201d is web-based and needs to visualize the products in a very upscale fashion. In addition, exhibitions and events shall be published. Result: www.malilian.com provides a fully functional communications channel between MaLiLian, professional partners e.g. architects, media and customers. At the same time the site provides the emotional backdrop for the product philosophy. www.malilian.com has delivered a strong interest in the furniture pieces resulting in numerous sales. Design: MaLiLian\u2019s expressive design asked for a sophisticated and very reduced graphic design. Playful exploration: One of the key features of the site is the user\u2019s easy and playful navigation in discovering the furniture objects. The site mirrors the quest for interaction posed by MaLiLian objects in real life. The user is able to discover them via different avenues such as the themes defined by surfaces and materials as well as by the shapes and functions of the furniture pieces. At the same time such path of discovery can be changed at any time of the exploration.

Diese eingeschr\u00e4nkte Interaktionsweise erfordert es, bei der Gestaltung der Screenlayouts in hohem Ma\u00dfe auf Benutzerfreundlichkeit und Bedienkomfort zu achten. Typografie und Farbdesign wurden hinsichtlich Lesbarkeit auf dem Fernsehschirm optimiert. Die systematische Anwendung von Farbkombinationen und -kontrasten unterst\u00fctzt eine klare Trennung zwischen den Bedien- und Anzeigeelementen und den vielschichtigen Informationen.
