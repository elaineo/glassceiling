Working as a member of Google's research team, I honed my skills as a data analyst and research scientist and had the opportunity to publish over a dozen research studies, papers, and articles sharing unique data driven insights. I have won several awards within Google for applying robust analysis and measurement to my initiatives. \n \nExperienced Marketer: Within Google, I have worked as a marketer on business facing products (AdWords & Enterprise) and consumer products(Gmail & Payments). Additionally, my work in the US and emerging markets gave me intimate experience in a range of marketing channels and activities (Digital, ATL, BTL activations, events).  \n \nProject Management: I have gained a wealth of experience as a project manage, earning increasingly large responsibilities and mandates within Google.
