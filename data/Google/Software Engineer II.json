Team Lead, Software Architect, Development Manager Master of Software Engineering Program, Carnegie Mellon University August 2010  \u2013  December 2011  (1 year 5 months) Pittsburgh, PA Worked on 16 months long team based project sponsored by Bosch as a team lead, software architect and development manager (the roles were rotated). Ported open-source simulation/modeling system, Ptolemy, to Android by creating distributed client/server system in order to work around hardware constraints on a handheld. In the resulting system, the handheld only handles inputs & outputs and the server takes care of heavy processing in order to meet performance requirements. The business driver for the project was to explore possible usability improvements of using Ptolemy on the go with a user interface customizable per model and user for a more focused work with a model/simulation. An example use case was Bosch\u2019s configuration engineers that use Ptolemy on a handheld to tune engine and its control units.

Personally wrote the first version of the system in C++ on top of Bigtable storage. \n- Engineered end-to-end metadata matching system that matches raw content from music labels and user uploads to existing music store records. The system supports the re-ingestion and matching of the entire music corpus in under a day, and instant update of newly ingested content in under 2 hours. \n \n- The Music Store Service powers the search and browsing experience in the Google Play music store, and is the central business server for music search results, purchase fulfillment, manually curated content, and customer reviews. It serves 20+K queries/second, 100+K orders and $300+K revenue per day. \n- Built the service in Java on top of ST index (search results), Zipit (reviews), and Checkout (orders). \n \n- Led a team of 6 to develop the frontend service in Java and client music player in JavaScript. Drove product features and designs with product managers and UI designers. Web Suggest - Software Engineer III, Tech Lead Google September 2006  \u2013  November 2007  (1 year 3 months) Mountain View, CA - Web Suggest is the feature that completes your query as you type in the search box. It started out as an experimental feature developed by 20% contributors. I was the first full-time engineer on the project. \n- As the Tech Lead of a 5-engineer team, productionized the system and graduated the product from experimental status. Drove the launch of the product in Asian markets (China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong). Achieved 25% feature adoption, increased average query length by 2%, and saved adopted users 48% keystrokes. \n- Using a Bayesian bigram model trained with query data in web logs, built the Chinese pinyin suggest feature that enabled Chinese users to input pinyin and get a list of matched Chinese character query completions. This greatly improved the search experience of Chinese users, allowing them to perform searches even when they do not have IME installed.
