One Google[x] project which is no longer confidential is Google Indoor Maps. Personally created the Google Indoor Maps field operations team, and oversaw all aspects of this organization including: strategic partner development in US and Japan, hiring and training employees in dozens of locations, deploying to thousands of partner venues for indoor map creation, indoor-location surveys, map quality assurance, POI labelling and indoor geocoding.  \n \nGoogle Indoor Maps couldn't have been successful without extraordinary effort by hundreds of talented contract employees, most of whom are military veterans. I personally interviewed more than 500 military vets in less than 100 days in early 2011, ultimately hiring more than 200. Due to the extraordinary competence and commitment of this team, Google Indoor Maps launched in November 2011 (less than one year after the program began).

Personally led non-engineering hiring, driver and technician training, sensor installation and systems integration, hardware and software acceptance testing, regression testing, mapping and self-driving vehicle operation for >250,000 miles of operation without incident on California highways. Initiated discussions with strategic business partners, law enforcement, and federal government.  \n \nAfter the self-driving cars program successfully met all its R&D goals, Google redoubled support for the project. We began the continuing process of building consumer products and business partnerships. \n \nThe success of Project Chauffeur led Google to create one of the top applied sciences R&D labs in the world, Google[x]. I became the head of operations for Google[x]. Senior Program Manager, Ground Truth (Google Maps) Google June 2008  \u2013  April 2009  (11 months) Hyderabad, India Oversaw operations for the largest map making team in the world. Increased size of \"GT Ops\" to roughly 1000 employees in less than a year, while simultaneously creating geometric increases in cartographer productivity and program cost-efficiency through semi-automated training and testing. If you prefer Google Maps to the recently-launched Apple maps, this may be because we've invested thousands of years of work to make the most useful map in history. :-) Operations Manager, Offline Ads Google January 2006  \u2013  May 2008  (2 years 5 months) New York, NY Fresh off revolutionizing the internet, and online advertising, Google began reinventing traditional media too.  \n \nWe created online markets (first a dutch auction, then automated bourse) for offline media; forged partnerships with every newspaper in the country, minus one; then automated the creation and reformatting of magazine and newspaper ads to reduce transaction costs and create a competitive advantage over the status quo. However, marrying online advertisers dependent on conversion metrics, to print publishers and traditional agencies dependent on opaque pricing models simply didn't work. It could have been different if cell phones and QR codes worked better then, or if the print industry leadership had been braver, or if our products had been more magical... but as it was Google Offline Ads was \"a bridge too far\" -- undeniably a failed strategic initiative for Google. In some ways, I wasted 2.5 years of my career. \n \nOn the other hand, I learned more about management in 2008 than I had during the previous 20 years combined. This experience, combined with what followed, taught me to move faster (even if that means losing faster), and to plan and execute every day like the life of your business is at stake. Because it is. Sales Operations Manager Google June 2003  \u2013  March 2006  (2 years 10 months) New York, NY I started my career at pre-IPO Google as a contractor, hired to help our ad sales team automate its internal systems, standardize practices and contract administration across disconnected offices, and document internal process controls for SOX compliance. I became a Google employee in Tim Armstrong's Direct Sales organization (DSO), as a Process and Compliance Specialist in the Sales Finance organization. After the IPO, I took on increasingly senior roles in more complex projects, creating multiple >$100M sales channels for Google ads products. I developed expertise entering new markets with novel sales and customer-support approaches, creating large teams with scaleable internal systems during hypergrowth periods; and during this time I was promoted twice.  \n \nIn general, my specialty is semi-automation, combining human \"brute force\" approaches with Google's unique engineering and infrastructure resources. I try to not prematurely optimize, which allows even large teams to move really fast-- tolerate tactical inefficiencies while achieving strategic victories.
