During the course of my undergraduate and graduate studies, I have worked on the design of six different space missions and have thoroughly enjoyed each of those experiences. I love designing and building things, be it antennas, circuit boards or mechanical assemblies. My goal is to work on novel space mission architectures and technologies that enable future space missions for understanding climate and Earth science, for space-based astronomy and space physics applications and for expanding the human frontier outwards in the solar system.
