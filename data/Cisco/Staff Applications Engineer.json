Tech Marketing Engineer, System Development Cisco March 2011  \u2013 Present (4 years 6 months) RTP My team delivered market-leading infrastructure solutions leveraging the latest industry innovations in mobility, wireless, security, video, energy management and virtual desktop delivery. My responsibilities included gathering customer requirements, creating solutions to meet those requirements, validation of the solution in the lab, creating a Cisco Validated Design, and presenting the designs via webinars, CiscoLive, and other outbound marketing channels. My team also provided live demonstrations directly to customers and Cisco sales teams. These demonstrations have closed several large opportunities as the competitive differentiator. Cisco IT is using components from several of the designs my team authored including the enterprise class teleworker. The following details the architectures I created or contributed to: \n \nSDN Transformation - Currently developing software to demonstrate Cisco\u2019s new SDN controller. The demo includes a web portal and illustrates how policy flows through layers from user requirements directly onto a tagged based containerized network environment in a simplified and elegant way. Flow based feedback provides security by profiling traffic against the policy templates. The web portal is written in JavaEE using the Spring framework, including Spring MVC, Spring Security, and Spring Social (LinkedIn). The portal can generate XML based mobileconfig files to remotely provision WiFi settings on Apple devices. The application is written in JavaFX 2.2 and SceneBuilder. I developed an SSL secured REST interface that uses JSON to integrates the portal to the application. In addition to integrating with the SDN controller, the application also integrates with Cisco PxGrid and the ISE ERS interface. I used both NetBeans 8.0 and Eclipse IDEs during development.

I also created network integration solutions around various MDM products and Cisco's Identity Service Engine (ISE)  \n \nBYOD - Created a solution that addresses the three phases of enterprise mobility where personal and corporate devices are commingled on the enterprise network. Created security policies in ISE required to onboard corporate and personal devices onto the wireless and wired network. Integrated with MS CA Server to issue x.509 EAP TLS certificates to these devices. Developed best practices around protecting corporate data including lost and stolen devices. Created hierarchal security policy based on device posture and user roles. Also used the REST API to integrate with 3rd party MDM providers. \n \nIn addition, my team created solutions around QoS, Security, Wireless, Energy management, IP Video Surveillance, Telepresence, IPv6, remote Teleworker, DMVPN design, and converged voice and security at the branch.

Created hierarchal security policy based on device posture and user roles. Also used the REST API to integrate with 3rd party MDM providers. \n \nIn addition, my team created solutions around QoS, Security, Wireless, Energy management, IP Video Surveillance, Telepresence, IPv6, remote Teleworker, DMVPN design, and converged voice and security at the branch. Consulting Engineer Cisco March 1999  \u2013  March 2001  (2 years 1 month) I provided professional network services to Cisco's largest global enterprise customers. Some of the projects I was involved with included PIM based multicast design and deployment including POC validation in Cisco PDVC lab. I also helped re-design a large global OSPF network with an iBGP core, including LSA optimization and ABR placement. Another project involved migrating an large network off of their ATM-LANE back bone, which they had over grown.
