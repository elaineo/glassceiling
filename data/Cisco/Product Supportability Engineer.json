Villanova University Six Sigma Green Belt,  Six Sigma , A 2014  \u2013 2014 Six Sigma seeks to improve the quality of process outputs by identifying and removing the causes of defects (errors) and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It uses a set of quality management methods, including statistical methods, and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization (\"Champions\", \"Black Belts\", \"Green Belts\", \"Yellow Belts\", etc.) who are experts in these methods. Each Six Sigma project carried out within an organization follows a defined sequence of steps and has quantified value targets, for example: reduce process cycle time, reduce pollution, reduce costs, increase customer satisfaction, and increase profits. These are also core to principles of Total Quality Management (TQM) as described by Peter Drucker and Tom Peters (particularly in his book \"The Pursuit of Excellence\" in which he refers to the Motorola six sigma principles).
