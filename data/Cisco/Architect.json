Data Center / Compute Domain Architect Cisco Systems January 2013  \u2013 Present (2 years 8 months) RTP, NC \u2022 As the Compute Domain Architect, I am responsible for the architecture blueprint and technology roadmap for global data center computing services across Cisco IT. The compute domain provides standardized OS instances, virtual machines and bare metal compute capabilities supporting engineering, global business units and IT applications, platforms and services. \n\u2022 I have developed the architecture for our next generation virtualized compute platform utilizing both OpenStack and VMware deployed on Cisco\u2019s Unified Computing System (UCS).  \n\u2022 I have developed a new architecture to converge compute resources across the data center into a general purpose, shared pool reducing resources deployed as application-specific infrastructure and reducing the infrastructure reserved for high availability/failure recovery. \n\u2022 I am responsible for the development and oversight of standards and policies applied to design, implementation and operation of the compute domain and ensuring compatibility with other infrastructure domains and client teams. Some of my key standardized operational policies have achieved a 30% increase in efficiency in the first year and with expected increases of 300-500% in subsequent years.

Senior Solution Architect Cisco May 2010  \u2013  January 2013  (2 years 9 months) RTP, NC \u2022 Responsible for leading teams of architects, design engineers and implementation engineers across multiple projects including both web based information systems as well as business critical transaction based systems. My duties include working with executive leadership from multiple organizations to understand and influence technical strategy and deliver clear direction to project teams. Notable programs include: \no Leading the re-architecture effort to upgrade and migrate the Cisco RMS platform. RMS is a service offering used to monitor and support customer networks and communication services including voice and video. The re-architecture effort involves the virtualization of multiple subsystems and requires transition plans allowing for minimal to zero interruption of customer services. \no Consolidation of multiple, globally disbursed Oracle ERP systems into a single system with increased infrastructure-level resilience, simplified architecture and reduced dependencies. \no Infrastructure Solution Architect for Exchange 2010 infrastructure architecture covering compute, storage and networking aspects for more than 100K users. Global architecture is distributed across multiple locations including geographically separate disaster recovery capacilities. \no Solution Architect for Metro Virtual Data Center (MVDC) resiliency system. MVDC uses two data centers in a single metro area to enable failover redundancy providing increased resiliency for the failure of Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings up through the loss of an entire data center. Responsible for overall MVDC architectural guidance as well as architectural strategy for scaling adoption, evolving MVDC platform and infrastructure capabilities and aligning the MVDC architectural strategy with Cisco\u2019s Disaster Recovery architecture.
