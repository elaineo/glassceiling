I first heard about opportunities in the field after talking with a customer at the bar, who told me about the Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification. I bought the book, took the test, and became certified! After that I kept going and obtained my Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) Certification in August 2012. I then completed the written exam and the lab for the Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert (CCIE) Program in March, 2013. My CCIE number is 38,549. I recertified my R&S CCIE in March 2014. \n \nI have also completed the CCNA Security (June 2013), CCNA Data Center (Feb 2014), and, most recently, I passed the CCIE written (August 2014) and lab exam for the Data Center track (May 2015). I am now a double CCIE. \n \nWork Experience: \nI spent approximately 6 months working for Kodak in late 2010- early 2011, where I was a helpdesk technician. Afterwards, I received an offer from Cisco to enter into the company as a contractor. I quickly accepted, and spent about a year and a half supporting a major Cisco customer as a Tier 1 network engineer. In August 2012, I received another offer within Cisco to become a direct-hire working as a network consultant for existing customers, and that is where I am right now.
