I've worked at start-ups, service providers, and large enterprise. Colleagues say I'm focused, even-keeled, and always able to deliver. \n \nAt service providers I managed peering with other companies, and won praise from customers for my ability to respond quickly to their concerns and troubleshoot issues effectively. Integration projects that required close collaboration with customers\u2019 engineers were my bread and butter. \n \nAt start-ups I worked closely with customers to integrate our products into their lab and production environments. I also worked closely with sales engineers, to build proof-of-concept labs and feature test beds in order to facilitate sales, among other things.  \n \nAt a large enterprise I have built networks for offices and data centers. I crisscrossed the Western Hemisphere to deploy network infrastructure, and guided teams of engineers on large-scale projects.  \n \nI am extremely good at translating geek to business, and vice-versa. I often spot dependencies that other people miss, and suggest efficiencies where they can be had. Documentation doesn't scare me; I am actually very good at it. In fact, I actually took technical writing classes on purpose (probably something you won't hear from a lot of network engineers). \n \nSo that's me in a nutshell. My strengths are enterprise and data center networking, collaboration, project analysis and management, technical and process documentation, and interfacing between technical and non-technical communities. \n \nFeel free to contact me if you would like to know more.
