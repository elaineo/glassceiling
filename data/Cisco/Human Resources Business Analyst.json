you're looking to connect with me socially then you can find me on Facebook.  \n \nHere I want to talk about my professional career and I will not repeat what my resume says. To sum it all up, I've been with Cisco for over 8 years. I was integral in the establishment of the Human Resources Connection (HRC) in RTP, NC and worked extensively in the department as a specialist and the SME for Compensation, as well as, for Payroll. I had significant input into both the establishment of the RTP center and process improvements with service delivery. I was also instrumental in the rollout of Compensation Planner and the training of the HRC representatives, as well as, end users for the Mid Year Focal and Year End Focal Planning Initiative. My position within the HRC AND prior roles provided me with a unique experience set into HR Operations at Cisco.  \n \nAfter my time in the HRC I transitioned to Talent Acquisition Global Operations working as a Talent Acquisition (TA) Systems Support Administrator. This role has allowed me to be responsible for support and guidance to all global TA System (VirtualEdge) related issues and inquiries. I have honed my research skills and have been responsible for testing configuration changes, as well as, new functionality prior to production rollout to the end-users. I also perform tasks such as periodic audits to ensure data integrity, access management, etc. \n \nAdditionally, I was the lead on a few projects that are listed. \n \nLastly, I am trained in DMAIC methodology (define,measure, analyze, improve and control) as well as multi-task. \n \nThat's me.
