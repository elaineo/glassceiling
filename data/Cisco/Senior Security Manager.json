Credentialed Authentic Leadership and Career Coach Be The Leaf Coaching, LLC March 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 6 months) Franktown, Virginia Society, family, work, friends...they all have expectations of us. Sometimes we lose ourselves in the quest to please others, I know I did! Through thoughtful questioning and reflection, coaching can provide insight into what makes you authentic and uncovers ways to stay true to your authentic self while navigating the chaotic waters of our lives.  \n \nResearch shows that the chain of impact from coaching leads to improved leadership effectiveness which in turn leads to tangible business impacts such as increased productivity, higher quality of work, retention of key employees and improved customer service. The less tangible, but equally important, business impacts include improved relationships and team work, higher job satisfaction, and reduced conflict (McGovern, Lindemann, Vergara, Murphy, Barker, Warrenfeltz, 2001).
