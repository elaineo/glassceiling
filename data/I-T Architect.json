I embrace 'change' and the 'unknown', given the rewards that these opportunities often bring. \n \nExperienced in communicating with all levels of the business, using good communication. I prefer a direct hands on approach, of discussing, listening and teasing out ideas and facts, before making design and implementation decisions; I believe stronger solutions are founded this way, which has led to many successful implementations, with all collaborators buying into an agreed and common goal. I'm also experienced in directing projects utilizing on shore and off shore resources; understanding the complexity of this. \n \nI like to understand the \"complete picture\" as an architect as well as appreciating the details \"under the hood\" as a developer. I've experienced full life cycle development, serving many hours in production support trenches; therefore my problem analysis, strategic diagnosis and deduction skills are formed on strong and successful experience. I prefer to prototype and test led development, but am also comfortable working in a traditional waterfall approach of design, development and delivery. With applied experience of requirement gathering, gap analysis, software component selection/adoption and then design and delivery.
