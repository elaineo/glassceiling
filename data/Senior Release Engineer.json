Currently it stores information about user accounts, groups, and infrastructure. \n \n\u2014 Track the corp database library usage on the client side. \nWhile backend logs can report the time taken to process each individual backend request, they do not include network latency to the end user, also a single command invocation may require multiple backend requests to finish. The goal of this project is to implement a server that receives metrics (as proto-buffers) and make them available to query and analyse. The server was implemented in Go, the client (written in python) was also modified to collect and send the metrics with no added latency to the user. \n \n\u2014 Provide SRE support for the corp database. \nAs an SRE my responsabilities were : \n1.

Release Engineer/Manager Wildfire by Google January 2014  \u2013  March 2014  (3 months) Mountain View, CA \u2014 Coordinate bi-weekly releases. \nWe have 11 applications in Wild\ufb01re suite. Each of them is released on bi-weekly schedule by the engineering team developing it. My role is to supervise the releases and help to get the application on the production environment as scheduled. \n\u2014 Improving Wild\ufb01re release process. \nThis project is all about designing the tools and process to release our ruby-on-rails based applications to production while taking advantage of Google internal tools. \n\u2014 Cross-applications updates. \nAs a release manager, my responsibilities include cross-applications updates. Here are a few examples: \n1. Feature gating release. \nOur engineering team in London implemented \"feature gating\" functionality, which allows us to switch on/o\ufb00 features instantly via a web interface. Enabling this feature required coordination between our teams to perform several applications and infrastructure updates over a two months period. My role was to track, supervise and provide support for our engineering team. \n2. UI-Toolkit security. \nOur applications use a common UI library, called UI-Toolkit. A security issue was \ufb01xed during a recent release, my role was to coordinate an ASAP release of all of our major applications and provide support wherever it was needed. Web Developer / Wild\ufb01re Pages Wildfire by Google November 2012  \u2013  December 2013  (1 year 2 months) Mountain View, CA Wild\ufb01re Pages is the most used application of the Wild\ufb01re suite. It allows customers to create pages on their Facebook brand page with social authentication without any Web Developing knowledge by simply using pre-made templates (or ordering a custom template). The page\u2019s content can be Gallery with votes, sweepstakes, signup forms, and/or many other possibilities. I was a part of the team working solely on Pages and the libraries/small applications that it \nwas using. We worked on designing, implementing, testing, supporting and releasing the applications. Software Engineer Contractor / Wild\ufb01re Bspoke Wildfire by Google July 2012  \u2013  October 2012  (4 months) Rennes, France Wild\ufb01re Bspoke is a pluggable application into Wild\ufb01re Pages. It is designed to transmit the data submitted by the end user to the signup form to our customers\u2019 proprietary CRM. I single handedly designed the application from the ground up with HMAC-secured connection between Pages and Bspoke (for fraud prevention). It has built-in support for multiple CRM platforms : Salesforce, MailChimp, CheetahMail, ExactTarget and basically any CRM accepting FORM POST, JSON or SOAP encapsulated data. The data is sent to the CRM in a background job decoupled from \nthe initial HTTP request. The project was later on-boarded along with me to the Pages team, who are currently maintaining the project. Software Engineer / System Administrator Agence Durable September 2010  \u2013  July 2012  (1 year 11 months) Rennes, France My responsibilities: \n\u2014 Web Development. \nIn charge of all of their website development and integration using Contao CMS.

Building the template using pure HTML/CSS, animate the website using CSS3/Javascript. \nUsing Compass to manage CSS across browsers and create sprites for all the images on the website. Contao CMS was written in PHP, so are all of the custom modules that I built per website basis. \n\u2014 Asset Library. \nContao has an integrated web interface for CSS and Javascript development, which was very time consuming and error prone. I replaced the web interface with support for SASS and Co\ufb00eeScript \ufb01les, compiled by a custom Ruby library based on the Rails asset pipeline. \n\u2014 System administrator. \nTheir servers were previously manually provisioned and maintained with zero monitoring. My role was to integrate Chef for automatic server provisioning and use Monit for monitoring, implementing a simple escalation system. I was on-call for the duration of my employment. \n\u2014 Release Engineer. \nPreviously, the deployment was accomplished by manually uploading a ZIP \ufb01le to the server, creating the corresponding Apache con\ufb01guration \ufb01le. Next unzipping the code and restarting the web server - all of which was manual. The process was time consuming and error prone. \nI designed, using Chef and Capistrano, a deployment system that was able to: \n1. Provision the new server. \n2. Create the corresponding DNS entry in their DNS server. \n3. Con\ufb01gure the Web server (Apache was also replaced with Nginx). \n4. Con\ufb01gure the MySQL server and create a database for the project. \n5. Deploy the code. \nTheir new deployment system was full-proof, taking less than 10 minutes to deploy the website. \n\u2014 IT support. \nI was also, as part of my job, providing IT support and maintaining their internal network. \nLanguages used : PHP, Python, Ruby, Bash Software Engineer Contractor / Wild\ufb01re Account Management Wildfire by Google February 2012  \u2013  June 2012  (5 months) Rennes, France Wild\ufb01re Account Management is the administration panel of Wild\ufb01re.

Reduced the size of the main git repository using the git repository pruning tool BFG. Release Engineer Google January 2010  \u2013  August 2012  (2 years 8 months) 1/2010 to 9/2011: Client software release engineering: worked on a client software build, test, and packaging system that builds several hundred client software products for Linux/OSX/iOS/Android/Windows: \n \n* Authored build system project execution workflow definitions in the build system\u2019s XML project definition language for new projects. Migrated dozens of projects from an older build system to the current system, by authoring XML project execution workflow definitions using a new macro library that differed from the code used in the old build system. Assisted users with debugging of build configuration and execution. Performed system administration for this build system's machines. Miscellaneous build-system-related Python programming. \n \n* To address improving productivity of authoring of the XML build system project workflow definition files, built a prototype of an XML build configuration file generator in Scala. \n \n10/2011 to 8/2012: Server-side release engineering: \n \n* Authored release tool project definitions for server-side projects that are released using both the new internal release tool and the legacy release tool, including definition and debugging the configurations with development teams. Both old and new release tools automate releases from source code control system checkout, through build, test, and deployment. \n \n* Wrote a Python utility that automated formerly manual bulk updates of release progress historical data. This code includes unit tests that mocked out the RPC service that stores the data using Python\u2019s mox mocking package. \n \n* Miscellaneous development team release assistance, including debugging and resolving problems with their builds, tests, and deployments when these were executed on our release tool\u2019s build machines. Release Engineer Namco Bandai Games America February 2009  \u2013  January 2010  (1 year) Refactored an existing Python 10,000+ line production video game art asset build system, improving its modularity, reliability, and performance. The system was monolithic and known to be problematic during maintenance changes, and I improved this condition by splitting it up into several separate Python modules. Addressed performance problems by moving from Python 2.4 to 2.6, enabling usage of the faster C-based profiler, profiling, and making data structure changes to avoid slow data structure searches. Improved reliability by analyzing cases where exception handling was swallowing exceptions that should not have been silently ignored, and fixing these cases with more precise exception handling. \n \nImplemented a Perforce \"workspace-versus-Perforce-depot\" comparison tool using the P4 Python API, and partially ported this to the P4 Java API being called from Jython. The intent of trying Jython was to compare the performance, threading, and robustness of P4's Java API versus the P4 Python API. During work with Perforce support to analyze API errors, ported some Jython P4 Java API-calling code to Java, to verify that Jython was not causing problems. Build/Release Engineer Rearden Commerce September 2007  \u2013  November 2008  (1 year 3 months) Responsible for installation, configuration, and failure analysis of builds of several branches of Rearden's code. The builds were scheduled by Hudson (now called Jenkins), CruiseControl, or custom Bash scripts. \n \nEvaluated and deployed Hudson as a replacement for CruiseControl and Bash-based build schedulers. Hudson has many advantages, notably the ability to schedule a large number of distinct builds on different hosts automatically, enabling us to support building 20+ branches on a small number of machines, and simpler configuration of builds. \n \nReplaced a set of cron jobs on several hosts with Hudson as a centralized job scheduler for job execution on remote machines, resulting in a more efficient job configuration and management process, and producing a single UI for reviewing and managing jobs and job results. This replaced the previous configuration process of logging in to each machine and altering the machines's crontab, which had no centralized ability to review all machines' job execution history and logs. \n \nCreated a Hudson-based build environment that automated the build process so that non-programmer front-end web developers who worked in HTML/Javascript/CSS were able to build the product in their working directory by clicking one button. \n \nServed as the group's first resource for handling system administration, resolving machine problems, or analyzing/solving performance problems in our group's machines.
