By understanding people\u2019s mental models and how they make sense of the world, it helps identify new opportunities to design something that people would actually find valuable and meaningful.  \n \nUltimately, the decision to choose one product/service over another can partly be attributed to its features. However, there is more to consumer decision making than simply comparing product/services at the feature level. Oftentimes, the most influential factors shaping what and why we buy are our perceptions, goals, and values. For that reason, throughout my career and academic studies I have studied people from a multidisciplinary approach of psychology, economic, user experience, and human factors engineering.
