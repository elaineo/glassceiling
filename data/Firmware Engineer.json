Worked on a joint development to port IBM code to a non-IBM hardware for potential use in xSeries servers. Modified a limited host driver to do the initial code load into flash and test cards as part of the manufacturing process. Redesigned the code to handle switching from a internally produced kernel to the vxWorks kernel while maintaining some specialized requirements of the hardware.
