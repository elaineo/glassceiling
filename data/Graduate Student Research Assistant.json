Autism Glass project is a collaboration with psychologists, human-computer interaction experts, and a bioinformatician aimed at studying the efficacy of a wearable device with facial expression recognition technology that delivers feedback to the wearer. In this project , my work has been focused on applying machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize the facial expressions. The purpose of this project is to build a new tool on Google Glass to help the autistic users to learn these facial expressions on their own instead of using current learning tools. Graduate Student Research Assistant Stanford University School of Medicine September 2014  \u2013  January 2015  (5 months) As a data scientist in VA hospital, my research focused on integrative transcriptomics and epigenomic analysis in neurodegeneration and ageing. In this research, we studied the influence of infusions of blood plasma from young mice on old mice. My collaboration included to combine my computer algorithms knowledge with machine learning techniques to apply computational methods to a hippocampal RNASeq data set and analyze it in terms of gene differential expression. The purpose of this project was to study the corresponding neurophysiological changes in the old mice that may help to find new ways to prevent Alzheimer disease.

Experience Graduate Student Research Assistant Stanford University April 2015  \u2013 Present (5 months) Stanford University I find work here to be revolutionary. I am working on economising a relatively new renewable energy source - energy from the salinity gradient between Freshwater and Seawater or 'Blue Energy'\u200b. I am excited about electrochemistry and the optimization of harvesting this energy.  \n \nI get to work with greats like Dr. Yi Cui and Dr. Craig Criddle, 'Nature'\u200b published professors. \n \nAlso, for the first time in my life, I get to say, 'Patent Pending'!! Internship University of Calabria May 2014  \u2013  August 2014  (4 months) Reggio Calabria Area, Italy This was one of the best times of my life in the scenic countryside of Italy, also exciting because of Mafia control over the area in which the University of Calabria is located. I spent 4 months in Italy working on the Membrane Distillation process. \n \nAccording to me, Membrane distillation is a massively underrated technology that can be used for the purification of water. The process though being very easy to understand, implement and realise has not earned much attention because of the economics related to the process. But with new technology, these constraints have been overcome and the advantages of the process completely outweigh its disadvantages. This makes it a very potent technology in the future of water purification and this inspired me to work on it. \n \nIn Italy, ITM-CNR is an one of a kind institution which specialises in membranes that are used to filter water for domestic and pollution control purposes. The institute was pioneered by Dr. Enrico Drioli, the world famous Stalwart in Water Purification Technology.  \n \nI worked in this institute for four months. My work involved studying and standardizing the Membrane distillation process for the inevitable large scale use of the process in the near future, along with a team of 7 experts. We were able to perform Correlation Analysis between input and output parameters of the process and thereby predict trends in the process' behaviour for changing input conditions.  \n \nWe were able to standardize and predict the behaviour of the process for Temperature and Pressure changes. A concentration change study was also performed, the data was insufficient to come to a conclusion in the time I was there, but eventually after I finished the internship, the group also standardized the behaviour of the process with changing Concentration of the feed solution. \n \nThis experience was both knowledge-rich and abstract, since the group was working on a technology that has not been studied much.

Graduate Student Research Assistant Stanford University April 2015  \u2013 Present (5 months) Stanford University I find work here to be revolutionary. I am working on economising a relatively new renewable energy source - energy from the salinity gradient between Freshwater and Seawater or 'Blue Energy'\u200b. I am excited about electrochemistry and the optimization of harvesting this energy.  \n \nI get to work with greats like Dr. Yi Cui and Dr. Craig Criddle, 'Nature'\u200b published professors. \n \nAlso, for the first time in my life, I get to say, 'Patent Pending'!!

Internship University of Calabria May 2014  \u2013  August 2014  (4 months) Reggio Calabria Area, Italy This was one of the best times of my life in the scenic countryside of Italy, also exciting because of Mafia control over the area in which the University of Calabria is located. I spent 4 months in Italy working on the Membrane Distillation process. \n \nAccording to me, Membrane distillation is a massively underrated technology that can be used for the purification of water. The process though being very easy to understand, implement and realise has not earned much attention because of the economics related to the process. But with new technology, these constraints have been overcome and the advantages of the process completely outweigh its disadvantages. This makes it a very potent technology in the future of water purification and this inspired me to work on it. \n \nIn Italy, ITM-CNR is an one of a kind institution which specialises in membranes that are used to filter water for domestic and pollution control purposes.

I interned for a summer in Construction Management at W.E. O'Neil Construction in El Segundo, CA and worked in a UCLA Structural Engineering Lab. I recently completed Stanford University's Environmental Fluid Mechanics and Hydrology Master's program, while acting as a research assistant for Water in the West's California Groundwater Resources visualization project. \n \nIn May 2013, I was accepted into the US Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate (NUPOC) program, and started Officer Candidate School (OCS) in January 2014. Unfortunately, I was deemed not physically qualified for Naval service during OCS, as the conditions aggravated asthmatic symptoms, and was honorably discharged.
