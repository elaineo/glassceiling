Experience Mobile Application Developer at IBM IBM June 2015  \u2013 Present (3 months) Herndon, VA As an intern my main goal is to Develop Android Application on Android Platform.  Research Assistant Jackson State University August 2013  \u2013  May 2015  (1 year 10 months) Jackson, Mississippi Area The goal of the Student Open Source Software (SOSS) Community project is to educate Computer Science (CS) students through real-world software development activities in order to produce a well-educated and well-trained workforce. This project introduces a student-centered open source software community as a supplementary educational model to the traditional lecture-based teaching environment. The objectives of the SOSS Community are as follows: \n \n\u2022 To provide a virtual classroom for CS majors at any level  \n\u2022 To produce software source code for Jackson State University (JSU) communities \n\u2022 To develop an educational model utilizing OSS products and the OSS community. \n \nThe strategies to accomplish the proposed objectives are to use and adopt OSS community structures and OSS products. The server is complete and now functioning for couple of courses. Though we have projects that me and my team currently working that can be incorporated to this project.

The objective of this research is to instrument Android mobile devices in real-time. This is important because it will allow us to analyze its performance properties (e.g., performance anomalies, trends in resource usage over time, and best/worst-case scenarios for individual applications) of Android devices while it is executing the 10s to 100s of applications running on a single device.
