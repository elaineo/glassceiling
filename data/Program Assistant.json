Experience PhD Candidate Stanford University September 2010  \u2013 Present (5 years) Renee Reijo Pera Laboratory As a graduate student I have developed an independent project to investigate the gene expression changes in single cells across multiple developmental states. Specifically, I have focused on developmental states relevant to the reprogramming of human cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) including early and late passage iPSCs as well as the fibroblasts from which they were derived. I helped pioneer mRNA reprogramming in our lab for this purpose and have generated iPSC lines that have been used in our lab for multiple purposes. I have also gained significant experience in single cell qRT-PCR for assaying gene expression. I focused on characterizing X chromosome dynamics in these developmental states including X chromosome inactivation. I have also begun taking a bioinformatics approach to better understand the data I have generated, improving my basic programming and statistical analysis skills. My graduate work will culminate in two first-author papers describing my novel findings. Head Community Associate Stanford University June 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 3 months) As Head Community Associate, I manage a team of 20 graduate students to provide social and educational events to graduate students. I interface with University employees to ensure that our team has the resources they need to be successful as well as work behind the scenes to support our team. I run team meetings on a bi-weekly basis and am the contact person for problems when they arise. Head Program Assistant Stanford University School of Medicine April 2014  \u2013  September 2014  (6 months) As the Head Program Assistant for the Stanford Summer Research Program, I hired five graduate Program Assistants for the summer, evaluated program applications for admission, and worked with the program directors to improve the program. Specifically, I developed a new way to recruit research mentors for incoming students and improved our current orientation program for students. I led weekly meetings with the team and directors, solved program problems when they arose as well as mentoring four students throughout the summer. Community Associate Stanford University September 2011  \u2013  June 2014  (2 years 10 months) I organized social and education events for 700 graduate students. I worked with a team of 20 other graduate students to put on large, campus-wide events. I was a resource for connecting graduate students with University resources as well as providing a social outlet for new students. Program Assistant Stanford University School of Medicine April 2012  \u2013  August 2013  (1 year 5 months) As a Program Assistant for the Stanford Summer Research Program I was a scientific and professional mentor to four undergraduate students each summer while they completed a 10-week summer research program. I facilitated weekly meetings with students, providing written, verbal, and one-on-one feedback on all aspects of their summer experience including research projects, scientific presentations, and written personal statements. Additionally, I worked with a team of 9 graduate students to provide professional development and social programs for the entire group of 32 students. Personally I developed and led a workshop on writing effective personal statements, components of an academic CV, and understanding challenges related to gender in science. Major Instructor Stanford College Prep July 2011  \u2013  July 2011  (1 month) I developed, taught, and evaluated a course on stem cell biology for high school students during a three-week summer program. In addition, I tutored students in the program on a weekly basis on their homework. The program was designed to give low-income, minority students extra academic help as well as provide an introduction to possible fields they could pursue in college.
