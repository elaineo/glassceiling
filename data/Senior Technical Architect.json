Important feature of OSC contain a complex mathematical model simulating the supply chain functionality. Designed & development of the first java-based and web-based implementation of the financial model at SMG. Developed software that translates model designed in PowerSim into java-based code. Developed software enabled us to directly translate complex financial models developed using PowerSim into Java Code (with minimal amount of user manipulation). Provided extensive consultation to other solutions under development as well as writing software to facilitate this development. Software includes system that automatically parses simulation storyboards and automatically populates the database.
