Developed appropriate models in SPSS to predict engine failures using logistic regression and Cox regression. \n \nClient: Large North American Pipeline Company \nProject: Pipeline Planning and Scheduling System \nServed as the Optimization Team Lead on a project to develop a planning and scheduling system for the movement of various oil commodities through the pipeline and terminal networks. Directed a team of three O.R professionals and three Java developers that successfully designed and developed an integer programming optimization model to determine the optimal sequence and flow rates for shipments that minimize power costs and shutdowns while satisfying various operational and user constraints. The model was implemented using CPLEX Optimization Studio and deployed as a web service using WebLogic. \n \nClient: Large North American Electrical Power Distributor \nProject: Distributed Generation Pilot Program \nServed as an Optimization Expert on a pilot project to support Distributed Generation connections to an existing electrical distribution network. Successfully developed an integer programming model that optimized the disconnect/connect schedule for solar generators that minimized the amount of lost generation and satisfied technical operational constraints. The model was implemented using CPLEX Optimization Studio, interfaced with an Oracle 11 database, and was deployed using SPSS\u00ae Collaboration and Deployment Services.
