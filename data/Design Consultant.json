Designed numerous circuit boards, and participated in many large-group design projects, such as new linecard ASIC \"engine\" design and bringup projects, as well as extensive switch-fabric design and debug work. I was a key contributor to numerous successful \"all-hands-on-deck\" high-priority and high-complexity system debug efforts. I managed our group's engineering lab, as a direct continuation of my work at StratumOne. Following the birth of our second child, I resigned to allow my wife to return to work while I raised our children until they reached preschool age. Hardware Design Engineer StratumOne Communications September 1998  \u2013  October 1999  (1 year 2 months) Santa Clara, CA Established the printed circuit development infrastructure for this rapidly-growing VC-backed fabless semiconductor startup, working with high-speed networking interfaces (OC48, OC192). Assisted with development of ASIC I/O layout optimization tools and strategies for signal integrity, designed evaluation board for a \"framer\" ASIC, developed and managed hardware laboratory and corporate PCB CAD infrastructure. I also interviewed many additional board design engineer candidates, and hired one truly excellent engineer. StratumOne was purchased by Cisco in 1999, less than 18 months after it was founded. Hardware Design Engineer, Contractor PSO Systems August 1998  \u2013  September 1998  (2 months) Oakland, CA This was a very small startup (3 people) self-funded by the founder to create a small ARM-based network fileserver appliance.

Hardware Design Engineer, Student Intern Sun Microsystems September 1992  \u2013  October 1996  (4 years 2 months) Menlo Park and Mountain View, CA After my summer internship was over, I then talked my way into an undercover \"internship\" position for a project that had been denied funding within SunLabs. Using office supply funds and sampled ICs, and later some incremental and reluctant budget allocations from management, I designed and built the world's first color touchscreen tablet computer, along with my boss and partner-in-crime Dick Sillman. This work became the foundations of an ongoing mobile computing research group in Sun's Technology Development group. After I finally went back to school to complete the remaining coursework for my degree, on my return to Sun I learned that the project I'd intended to work on had been canceled. I then elected to pursue opportunities outside of Sun rather than continue with the alternate internal position I'd been offered. Summer Internship Researcher Sun Microsystems Laboratories, Inc. June 1992  \u2013  August 1992  (3 months) Mountain View, CA Implemented distributed transaction processing facilities using a multi-level two-phase commit algorithm for the SpringOS object-oriented operating system research project.

Hardware Design Engineer, Undergraduate Research Assistant IBM-UCSC Joint Study in Supercomputer Research November 1989  \u2013  June 1992  (2 years 8 months) UC Santa Cruz, CA Contributed to architecture, design and implementation of a coherent shared-memory bus with custom L3 caches and bus controllers running multiple i860 CPUs. Technical Support Technician Tall Tree Systems June 1985  \u2013  June 1987  (2 years 1 month) Palo Alto, CA This was a garage startup that developed the original multi-megabyte IBM PC memory expansion cards, which later formed the (\"uncredited\") basis for the popular EMS bank-switched memory architecture. I started by working in shipping, then production-line hardware testing, and then production board debug/rework, and finally settled into tech support for the rest of my time in high school, during summers and after-school. Computer Tutor Stanford University June 1983  \u2013  August 1983  (3 months) Palo Alto, CA Hired to teach Basic programming for a summer seminar on Microcomputers in Education by the Stanford School of Education. This program was led by Joan Targ, who also ran the Computer Tutors program at Jordan Junior High in Palo Alto. I also volunteered to teach Basic programming on North Star Horizon CP/M and then IBM PC machines for this program during the school years I attended Jordan.

Hardware Design Engineer, Student Intern Sun Microsystems September 1992  \u2013  October 1996  (4 years 2 months) Menlo Park and Mountain View, CA After my summer internship was over, I then talked my way into an undercover \"internship\" position for a project that had been denied funding within SunLabs. Using office supply funds and sampled ICs, and later some incremental and reluctant budget allocations from management, I designed and built the world's first color touchscreen tablet computer, along with my boss and partner-in-crime Dick Sillman. This work became the foundations of an ongoing mobile computing research group in Sun's Technology Development group. After I finally went back to school to complete the remaining coursework for my degree, on my return to Sun I learned that the project I'd intended to work on had been canceled. I then elected to pursue opportunities outside of Sun rather than continue with the alternate internal position I'd been offered.
