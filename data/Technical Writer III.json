seasoned technical writer, Steve DeMont has worked for a variety of small to mid-size companies as well as major corporations that include Amazon, Cisco, HP, and Microsoft. He has written white papers, user guides, SDK and API guides, software and hardware configuration guides, and network design and data center requirements documentation that address the needs of a wide variety of audiences.  \n \nIn addition to producing quality documentation, Steve has managed SharePoint sites and other types of documentation repositories to provide a comprehensive means for managing a company's documentation assets. \n \nGetting the job done, and getting it done right in a timely fashion is central to Steve's can-do, get-it-done creative spirit. He has shown that he takes the initiative when finding solutions to difficult challenges. For instance, he successfully planned and implemented the use of a SharePoint documentation repository for enabling subject matter experts to collaborate on their documentation efforts between the US and China. The key challenges of language barriers, time zones, and international legal constraints were taken into consideration. The end result was a SharePoint site that provided a secure environment governed by common-sense process guidelines. \n \nWhen asked what makes an individual contributor successful, Steve remarks that: \"It's best to put aside personal agendas, and consider that success is best achieved when contributing to the success of others.\" Summary A seasoned technical writer, Steve DeMont has worked for a variety of small to mid-size companies as well as major corporations that include Amazon, Cisco, HP, and Microsoft.
