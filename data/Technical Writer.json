Great documentation is the result of developing and applying three principles: \n1. Developing a thorough understanding of your audience. \n2.

This can include a wide range of end-user collateral, such as online help systems, training guides and tutorials, and support documentation. \n \nA technical writer can also improve the internal communications in your development process. Examples include producing clear product specifications, developing use case analysis, diagramming architecture and data flow, and assisting with user interface design, or quality assurance. \n \nAs a technical writer, I provide easy and painless user assistance documentation right where it's needed - and in whatever forms that work best for you and your audience.
