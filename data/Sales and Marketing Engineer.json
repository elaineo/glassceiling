I thoroughly enjoyed the challenge during those years of home schooling our two children. Since returning to life on land, I've held board positions in two different youth-serving organizations. Currently, I am tutoring upper grades and college students in math -- subjects including College Math, Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II, and Pre-Calculus plus SAT /ACT test prep.

One of the very earliest things I remember asking for was a computer, and from that point on that was my passion. I loved seeing the latest gadgets and devices and seeing how they worked and seeing what vision each exciting new startup had for the world. \n \nSo naturally, my path as an electrical and computer engineer was already set for college. But as I started down that path, I realized there was another piece of the puzzle that left me wanting more than just the engineering side: people. It was during a senior design project when I realized that, though I loved engineering, what I found even more passion in was working with and partnering with people to accomplish goals together. \n \nFrom that point on, I knew I wanted to understand more about the business side and use that as a strength as well. I continued on to get a Masters of Engineering and an MBA. During my time in business school, I made it a point to focus on classes that revolved around people and relationships, such as negotiations and organizational behavior.  \n \nAs a result, I came away with an enormous passion for developing collaborative relationships and partnerships. Creating customer value isn't just a buzz phrase for me, but a key philosophical belief in how I approach all relationships. Summary Growing up, I was always fascinated by technology.
