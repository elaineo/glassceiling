As a platform manager this position requires me to blend my construction management techniques with proven software management techniques (Agile) and expanding my overall project management knowledgebase. To effectively manage the schedule platform I need vast knowledge not only of Intel's construction practices but also the manufacturing long range planning processes and systems. I am also a key team member on our Re-Plan In A Day (RPIAD) Team. This team is developing break through capabilities that analyze utility system capacities and demands over time with just the touch of a few buttons. This real time analysis will provide complete information to decision makers enabling capital spending decisions that allow Intel to better respond to market demands. This advanced technology is earning our team recognition from FIATECH and other industry consortia. Business Manager Intel Corporation 2007  \u2013  2008  (1 year) Business Manager for two large groups within Intel\u2019s global construction department. Here I researched, developed and implemented software and supporting business processes to manage dynamic resource needs. My solution allowed the Project Engineering team to better understand the roadmap of construction projects and the skill sets required to support those projects and compare those demands against the capabilities of the organization. This comparison allowed us to see where our resource gaps existed and mitigate those risks through hiring, headcount reassignment or managing the gap as a risk if appropriate. Schedule Group Lead Intel Corporation 2005  \u2013  2007  (2 years) In charge of developing and implementing standardized scheduling methodologies throughout Intel\u2019s global Assembly Test facilities. This position was focused on implementing Primavera and the suite of scheduling software applications in China, Costa Rica, Philippines and Malaysia. While working on this project I lived in Costa Rica for 1 year and travelled extensively through Asia learning to adapt to a wide variety of business cultures. I also trained the permanent workforce to manage the process long term enabling myself to move to the next project without any impacts to the project teams. Project Manager Intel Corporation 2002  \u2013  2004  (2 years) Project Manager for the construction and installation of manufacturing tools and equipment. This project was further complicated because all of the construction work was performed in an operating manufacturing facility requiring adherence to strict protocols. Additionally, was the PM for the New Mexico site demolition activities. This project consisted of the safe demolition of hundreds of manufacturing tools within an operating factory. During this project I lead teams of hundreds of craft personal as well as Intel technicians. This project broke world class safety records for 44 consecutive weeks with zero safety incidents or unsafe observations. Integration Scheduler Intel Corporation 2000  \u2013  2002  (2 years) Managed the construction schedule on the construction of F11X, the world\u2019s first 300mm high volume manufacturing facility. Here I was in charge of integrating the construction schedule for the base building with the construction schedule of the installation of the manufacturing tools/equipment. On this high profile project I developed a unique indicator that linked the schedule data with the AutoCAD layout to create a 2D model of the build out of the factory production space through time. This innovative tool enabled millions of dollars in savings through cost avoidance as planning issues were discovered and resolved before the occurred. Among other awards, I authored a paper and was invited to speak at the International Symposium on Semiconductor Manufacturing on this breakthrough work. Project Manager Gardner Zemke 1995  \u2013  2000  (5 years) Worked as a construction project manager for this large industrial electrical contractor. Gained experience managing projects spanning the full spectrum of possibilities. Just a few of the projects I worked on during this period are: Upgrading NASA Mission Control Switchgear, Pantex High Explosive Synthesis Facility, Shiprock Hospital, Hoffman AFB Wastewater Treatment Plant, upgrades to Lackland AFB Power Plant, Texas Dept of Criminal Justice Jail Facilities and more. This position also allowed me to work on both public and privately owned facilities, lump sum, design build and negotiated contracts as well as managing projects as both sub and prime contractors.
