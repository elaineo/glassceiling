Experience Software Engineer Intel Corporation August 2012  \u2013 Present (3 years 1 month) Worked for the Software Methodologies and Tools team. \nTrained 80% of the US based engineers working on net generation modem chips and provided 3rd line support. Principal Software Engineer Bytemobile August 2010  \u2013  August 2012  (2 years 1 month) Santa Clara Senior Software Engineer Brocade 2005  \u2013  August 2010  (5 years) San Jose Root caused lots of previously \u201cimpossible\u201d core files. \nGave almost weekly knowledge transfer sessions \nWrote program that monitored ASICs and \u201chot patched\u201d values to correct incorrect values, to avoid the need for costly rework of chips. Senior Software Engineer Syndeo Corporation 2002  \u2013  2004  (2 years) San Jose Designed and implemented a new build process. Net Result: Build time for full build cut from 8 hours to 2 hours, and build time overhead for incremental builds cut from 15 minutes to 12 seconds.  \n \nDesigned and implemented an \"autobuild\" system. Previously almost all numbered builds failed, wasting large amounts of time as people scrambled to provided fixes. Now 95% of numbered builds complete, and those that fail are known in advance. Net Result: Savings of over 2500 man-hours a year and a much more stable product. \n \nDesigned and implemented a new logging system. The original system slowed the system by a factor of 20, making logging unusable. The new one has negligible effect. Net Result: Logging is turned on in the field, enabling real time diagnosis of one-off issues without the need to reproduce them. Senior Software Engineer Marconi 2000  \u2013  2002  (2 years) Dallas/Fort Worth Area On Secondment from Marconi in the UK \n \nLed development of a GR303 residential gateway for the US market. Net Result: Made the first delivery to launch customer on target securing a $10 million order. \n \nSet up Lab, with 4 complete (but minimal) VoIP exchanges.

During that period I have actively participated in analyzing and designing the new features that newly introduced to the product. It is one of my responsibilities to conduct POCs, design the product features and create technical specifications together with senior Architect. I have used J2EE frameworks including spring, Hibernate, java Server Faces (JSF), JSP, Web services, RMI, etc. for the development of the application. Oracle and MySql are the supporting databases and liquibase used to track the db versions and migrations. I was responsible for developer level testing for the features that I have newly introduced to the product. The developer level tests are run on JUnit engine and Mokito. I also engaged in defect fixing and maintenance phases as well. Also wrote developer level documents and assist technical writers to create customer facing documentation.

Reaserch student University of Colombo School of Computing August 2010  \u2013  August 2011  (1 year 1 month) Srilanka For university final year research, I improved an effectiveness of file sharing mechanism in Eucalyptus based Cloud environment on top of Xen hypervisor. There are lots of approaches which have been taken to the improve effectiveness of file sharing in Eucalyptus based Cloud environment. We have been used two main approaches to address this problem, which did not harm the scalability of the Cloud environment. Our first approach, implement the locking mechanism for the cloud controller which act as the main control unit of the Cloud environment by adding the some classes to the Eucalyptus source package. Then as a next step we integrate version enabling mechanism for the Walrus by adding the copy on write feature with Btrfs file system. Finally we are able to keep the consistency with scalability by using above two approaches. \n \nResearch paper published : 2012 4TH International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology (ICCET 2012) Intern Aepona March 2010  \u2013  August 2010  (6 months) Sri Lanka Working as a J2EE programmer.

During that period I have actively participated in analyzing and designing the new features that newly introduced to the product. It is one of my responsibilities to conduct POCs, design the product features and create technical specifications together with senior Architect. I have used J2EE frameworks including spring, Hibernate, java Server Faces (JSF), JSP, Web services, RMI, etc. for the development of the application. Oracle and MySql are the supporting databases and liquibase used to track the db versions and migrations. I was responsible for developer level testing for the features that I have newly introduced to the product. The developer level tests are run on JUnit engine and Mokito. I also engaged in defect fixing and maintenance phases as well. Also wrote developer level documents and assist technical writers to create customer facing documentation.

There are lots of approaches which have been taken to the improve effectiveness of file sharing in Eucalyptus based Cloud environment. We have been used two main approaches to address this problem, which did not harm the scalability of the Cloud environment. Our first approach, implement the locking mechanism for the cloud controller which act as the main control unit of the Cloud environment by adding the some classes to the Eucalyptus source package. Then as a next step we integrate version enabling mechanism for the Walrus by adding the copy on write feature with Btrfs file system. Finally we are able to keep the consistency with scalability by using above two approaches. \n \nResearch paper published : 2012 4TH International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology (ICCET 2012) Reaserch student University of Colombo School of Computing August 2010  \u2013  August 2011  (1 year 1 month) Srilanka For university final year research, I improved an effectiveness of file sharing mechanism in Eucalyptus based Cloud environment on top of Xen hypervisor.
