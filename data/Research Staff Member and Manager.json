Watson Research Center after receiving a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology. Since then I have played research, advanced technology, and management roles, creating award-winning systems in support of interpersonal communications, ubiquitous computing, and web accessibility. I am currently managing the Watson Life Research team within the newly formed Watson Group at IBM and serving as an Honorary Professor in the School of Computing at the University of Dundee in Scotland. \n \nMy technical and professional contributions have been recognized by the Human Factors Society, the Association of Computing Machinery, the British Computer Society, ACM SIGPLAN, and several disability advocacy organizations. I've been active in the ACM SIGCHI, SIGPLAN, and SIGACCESS communities, chairing OOPSLA, the leading international conference on object-oriented programming, and serving as chair of the OOPSLA Steering Committee. I was named a Fellow of the ACM in 1997, elected a member of the IBM Academy of Technology in 2006, and named a Fellow of the British Computer Society in 2011. \n \nIn my spare time I play organ, piano, guitar, and mandolin.
