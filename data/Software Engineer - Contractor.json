Responsible for the design and implementation of an authentication mechanism which used certificates and private keys to authenticate machines and OS features to authenticate users. The project used OpenSSL to build certificates and private keys, to create TLS connections (TLS is the successor to SSLv3), and generate random numbers. The project required heavy use of threads. The result was required to work on all supported platforms (about 20 different platforms) in clustered and non-clustered environments. The authentication mechanism was written in C. \n \n2. Responsible for the design and implementation of a cross-platform (about 20 different platforms) communications API (written in C). The API uses XDR to encode and decode data transmitted over the wire. The API used an object oriented design which allowed the user to mix multiple user-defined protocols including an RPC server adapter in one select loop. \n \n3. Worked on NetWorker's authorization system. This project requires the ability to build user identity information which can be passed from a Windows machine to a Unix machine (or the other way around). \n \n4. Worked on an authentication mechanism which used the Kerberos GSS-API interface (Unix and Windows) and SSPI interface (Windows only) to authenticate an RPC client to an RPC server and vice versa. The RPC client/server were using the RPCSEC_GSS standard to send and receive security tokens (retrieved using the GSS-API or SSPI interface). I also used the GSS_Wrap functions (or SSPI equivalent) to encrypt packets. Software Engineer (Contractor) ARINC July 1999  \u2013  January 2001  (1 year 7 months) Annapolis, MD Worked as a programmer on the Linux, Sun Solaris and Windows 98/NT platforms. Designed and implemented a flat file database system. Included a client, a server, and a GUI. \n \n1. Server: Written in C for the Linux, Sun Solaris and Windows platforms. Designed an implemented indexing algorithms. Designed the protocol for requesting database entries. On the Solaris and Linux platforms, the server receives requests from the clients (and responds to requests) via a UNIX message queue. On the Windows platform, the server receives requests using sockets. \n \n2. Client: Written in C for the Linux, Sun Solaris and Windows platforms. The client was written as a library that was loaded by a third party program (like a plug-in). \n \n3. GUI: Written in Java using the Swing API to draw the GUI. The GUI was required to provide query, insert, update, and delete requests. Software Engineer (Contractor) MCI WorldCom August 1998  \u2013  July 1999  (1 year) Chantilly, VA Worked as a programmer on an HP-UX (Unix) platform using C, Perl and the Korn-shell scripting language.

Software Engineer (Contractor) IBM October 1996  \u2013  August 1998  (1 year 11 months) Manassas, VA Worked as a programmer on the MVS and Windows NT platforms using C/C++ and Visual Basic. Applications worked on: \n \n1. Server Application: Added features to an application written in C for MVS/CICS. Used Embedded SQL to access and return information stored in DB2 (database) tables. Used MQ Series to return information to a client application. Used AIF to send messages to a back end agent. \n \n2. Client Application: Added features to an application extension written in C for Windows NT. The application extension was written as a back end to a Visual Basic executable. It would translate the data sent in from the executable into a binary format and then put the data on an MQ Series queue. The program was also required to get messages from the queue and translate them into a format the Visual Basic executable could understand. \n \n3. Wrote a message building utility using Microsoft Visual Basic and C++. The utility used a Visual Basic executable and a C++ DLL to build the binary message format used for communication between applications. The application used COM to communicate between DLL and executable.
