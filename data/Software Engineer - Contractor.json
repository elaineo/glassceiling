Site Reliability Engineer Google April 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 4 months) Mountain View, CA The corp database is the centralized repository for Google\u2019s IT / Operations data. Currently it stores information about user accounts, groups, and infrastructure. \n \n\u2014 Track the corp database library usage on the client side. \nWhile backend logs can report the time taken to process each individual backend request, they do not include network latency to the end user, also a single command invocation may require multiple backend requests to finish. The goal of this project is to implement a server that receives metrics (as proto-buffers) and make them available to query and analyse. The server was implemented in Go, the client (written in python) was also modified to collect and send the metrics with no added latency to the user. \n \n\u2014 Provide SRE support for the corp database. \nAs an SRE my responsabilities were : \n1. Address all of the bugs opened against the database. \n2. Turn up a new cell in europe. \n \n\u2014 Work on the code, fix bugs and improve performance. \nLanguages used : Go, Python. \n \nAlongside my duties on the corp database project, I had also responsibilities on the corp infrastructure team responsible for the corp services (DNS, DHCP etc..), my responsabilities were : \n1. To address all of the weekly OnDuty tasks from bugs and tickets. \n2. To be OnCall and respond to pages. Release Engineer/Manager Wildfire by Google January 2014  \u2013  March 2014  (3 months) Mountain View, CA \u2014 Coordinate bi-weekly releases. \nWe have 11 applications in Wild\ufb01re suite. Each of them is released on bi-weekly schedule by the engineering team developing it. My role is to supervise the releases and help to get the application on the production environment as scheduled. \n\u2014 Improving Wild\ufb01re release process. \nThis project is all about designing the tools and process to release our ruby-on-rails based applications to production while taking advantage of Google internal tools. \n\u2014 Cross-applications updates. \nAs a release manager, my responsibilities include cross-applications updates. Here are a few examples: \n1. Feature gating release. \nOur engineering team in London implemented \"feature gating\" functionality, which allows us to switch on/o\ufb00 features instantly via a web interface. Enabling this feature required coordination between our teams to perform several applications and infrastructure updates over a two months period. My role was to track, supervise and provide support for our engineering team. \n2. UI-Toolkit security. \nOur applications use a common UI library, called UI-Toolkit. A security issue was \ufb01xed during a recent release, my role was to coordinate an ASAP release of all of our major applications and provide support wherever it was needed. Web Developer / Wild\ufb01re Pages Wildfire by Google November 2012  \u2013  December 2013  (1 year 2 months) Mountain View, CA Wild\ufb01re Pages is the most used application of the Wild\ufb01re suite. It allows customers to create pages on their Facebook brand page with social authentication without any Web Developing knowledge by simply using pre-made templates (or ordering a custom template). The page\u2019s content can be Gallery with votes, sweepstakes, signup forms, and/or many other possibilities. I was a part of the team working solely on Pages and the libraries/small applications that it \nwas using. We worked on designing, implementing, testing, supporting and releasing the applications. Software Engineer Contractor / Wild\ufb01re Bspoke Wildfire by Google July 2012  \u2013  October 2012  (4 months) Rennes, France Wild\ufb01re Bspoke is a pluggable application into Wild\ufb01re Pages. It is designed to transmit the data submitted by the end user to the signup form to our customers\u2019 proprietary CRM. I single handedly designed the application from the ground up with HMAC-secured connection between Pages and Bspoke (for fraud prevention). It has built-in support for multiple CRM platforms : Salesforce, MailChimp, CheetahMail, ExactTarget and basically any CRM accepting FORM POST, JSON or SOAP encapsulated data. The data is sent to the CRM in a background job decoupled from \nthe initial HTTP request. The project was later on-boarded along with me to the Pages team, who are currently maintaining the project. Software Engineer / System Administrator Agence Durable September 2010  \u2013  July 2012  (1 year 11 months) Rennes, France My responsibilities: \n\u2014 Web Development. \nIn charge of all of their website development and integration using Contao CMS. The designer provides me directly with the PSD \ufb01le. Using Adobe Photoshop cutting o\ufb00 the images and \ufb01nding the correct colors for each section. Building the template using pure HTML/CSS, animate the website using CSS3/Javascript. \nUsing Compass to manage CSS across browsers and create sprites for all the images on the website. Contao CMS was written in PHP, so are all of the custom modules that I built per website basis. \n\u2014 Asset Library. \nContao has an integrated web interface for CSS and Javascript development, which was very time consuming and error prone. I replaced the web interface with support for SASS and Co\ufb00eeScript \ufb01les, compiled by a custom Ruby library based on the Rails asset pipeline. \n\u2014 System administrator. \nTheir servers were previously manually provisioned and maintained with zero monitoring. My role was to integrate Chef for automatic server provisioning and use Monit for monitoring, implementing a simple escalation system. I was on-call for the duration of my employment. \n\u2014 Release Engineer. \nPreviously, the deployment was accomplished by manually uploading a ZIP \ufb01le to the server, creating the corresponding Apache con\ufb01guration \ufb01le. Next unzipping the code and restarting the web server - all of which was manual. The process was time consuming and error prone. \nI designed, using Chef and Capistrano, a deployment system that was able to: \n1. Provision the new server. \n2. Create the corresponding DNS entry in their DNS server. \n3. Con\ufb01gure the Web server (Apache was also replaced with Nginx). \n4. Con\ufb01gure the MySQL server and create a database for the project. \n5. Deploy the code. \nTheir new deployment system was full-proof, taking less than 10 minutes to deploy the website. \n\u2014 IT support. \nI was also, as part of my job, providing IT support and maintaining their internal network. \nLanguages used : PHP, Python, Ruby, Bash Software Engineer Contractor / Wild\ufb01re Account Management Wildfire by Google February 2012  \u2013  June 2012  (5 months) Rennes, France Wild\ufb01re Account Management is the administration panel of Wild\ufb01re. It allows companies to create accounts for their employees, create teams, de\ufb01ne permissions and link or con\ufb01gure their attached Facebook accounts. I was a part of the team working solely on Account Management alongside the client library \"Accounts Client\", which is used by all the other applications to make speci\ufb01c accounts or permission queries to Account Management. We worked on designing, implementing, testing, supporting and releasing the application. Software Engineer / System Administrator Weem May 2009  \u2013  January 2011  (1 year 9 months) Weem is a social suite designed mainly for employees. A place where they can chat, buy and sell their stu\ufb00. The suite is written in PHP and Zend Framework and is running on a dedicated web and database server. The company had only two people, the founder mainly worked on the marketing side and I worked on the application and the servers. \nMy Responsibilities: \n\u2014 Software Engineer. \nDesigning the features, writing the code, writing the tests and debugging for any backend or customer-facing issues. \n\u2014 System administrator. \nI was in charge of the provisions, monitoring, and maintenance of their servers. The servers were also automatically monitored by Monit, con\ufb01gured by me. \n\u2014 Release Engineer. \nPreviously, ZIP \ufb01les, accompanied by BAT scripts were used to deploy the application. My role was to design a new deployment system \ufb01t their use case. I designed a complete deployment system using simple Git hooks written in bash. By pushing the code to the production branch, the application is deployed to the server (similar to how we deploy code to Heroku). \nLanguages used : C, PHP, Bash Senior Full Stack Engineer Dailymotion March 2015  \u2013 Present (5 months) Palo Alto, CA Working on the Ad Squad.

The film will also focus on the victim's perspective and how firefighters have come to the rescue by saving loved ones and family members, relatives and friends. \n \nIn the Line of Duty will search and attempt to answer some complex yet straightforward questions: Why does one become a firefighter?
