Successfully completed the project goal of identification of the circumferential material properties of titanium tubing through finite element modelling and material testing. \n \nModel verification was completed through further material testing with a focus on the measurement of plastic elongation with strain gauging. \n \nThe research included finite element modelling and analysis using ANSYS, fixture design for material testing, the design and construction of analog hardware for strain gauge data acquisition. Research also utilized MTS axial test hardware, load cells and a LVDT. \n Undergraduate Research Assistant University of Wyoming Department of Mechanical Engineering January 2007  \u2013  May 2008  (1 year 5 months) Laramie, WY Performed research in the area of finite element analysis and materials testing.
