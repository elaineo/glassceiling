Experience Manufacturing Technician Intel Corporation November 2014  \u2013 Present (10 months) Chandler, Az Dry Etch/Fab 32 Install/ Machinist/Quality Control GT Advanced Technologies January 2014  \u2013  October 2014  (10 months) Mesa, Az I began in Install with the cabling team running cables thru conduits, running air hoses for the helium on oxygen, all to the central PDU cabinets and HMI screens. These were furnaces being built for the purpose of growing sapphire. Then I learned to attach the tree lights on all the 4,000 furnaces which covered 1.3 million square feet. I was also pulled into the fab to run DCM grinders to grind saw lines out and to prep for polishing on LapMaster polishers. My quality skills also took me to analyze the sapphire for lineage, measurements, and weight to begin fab processes. Manufacturing Technician L-3 Communications July 2013  \u2013  November 2013  (5 months) Tempe, Az I was hired to run the Straughsbaugh Stick Polisher, and did so with ease. I am experienced with several types of Straughsbaugh equipment. On the side I also did beveling on a Saida beveller. I also reworked power supplies as work slowed down. Then my position was eliminated due to cut backs. Shipping and Recieving/Panel Builder AeroSpec, Inc. March 2013  \u2013  June 2013  (4 months) Chandler, Az I received the shipments, filed the BOL, then added quantity to the inventory. When work slowed I was utilized in the panel shop to install wiring to the specs. With great regret from my employer, my position was eliminated due to company slow down and lack of work. Panel Builder Advanced Integrated Technologies July 2012  \u2013  September 2012  (3 months) Chandler, Az I built automation tools for solar and semiconductor clients. I became experienced in wire harnessing, running pneumatic lines with switches and pumps, and installed heavy higs using the hoisting crane. I tested connections per schematics and documented all pertinent information for engineering personnel. My accomplishment was having competed a tool from the beginning to the end then wrap it to have it shipped. All work was done in a cleanroom. My term ended due to cutbacks and lay offs. Manufacturing Technician Intel Corporation January 2012  \u2013  June 2012  (6 months) Phoenix, Arizona Area I worked in ATTD with the testing processes of Cores and Pentiums. My duties included yield enhancement with the test program expectations, environment control, and to maintain constant flow for engineering evaluation. My contract ended fulfilled. R and D Manufacturing Technician Trex Enterprises July 2011  \u2013  September 2011  (3 months) Sorrento Valley, CA Build fiber optic MEMS chips starting with the QC within the alignment, attachment of substrates and BGA soldering to complete packaging. I also worked with N2, LN2, and Hydrogen. Vacuum chambers, and user laser sensor soldering techniques. The final assembly was done in a glove box. Associate Test Engineer Intersil September 2010  \u2013  July 2011  (11 months) Rancho Bernardo, Ca Bench Set ups to test circuits as required for Corporate Senior Engineers to evaluate and improve customer satisfaction. Maintain catalog for hardware use and efficiency. Implement quality initiatives, keep lab organized, and minimal IT. I shipped completed products and ran shipping accounts for our division. Probe and Test Set Up Microchip Technology May 1997  \u2013  March 2010  (12 years 11 months) 2550 W. Chandler Blvd. Chandler, Az I started as an operator loading machines to probe the wafers. within three years I was promoted to a set-up technician and kept the WIP in full function with the shipping goals intended to meet quarterly expectations. Engineers came to rely on me and my expertise to qualify the newest test programs into production, My greatest accomplishments were the ability to manipulate the desired test results by swapping electronic components on the probe card itself. I've also tested packaged microcontrollers using LN2 for environmental control.
