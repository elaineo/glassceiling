Soon after his brief engagement at Bell Labs, he shifted his interests to software performance engineering in solving industry problem for financial firms. He then worked at Morgan Stanley, Instinet and Bear Stearns, covering front office, middle office and back office financial products with high volume and complexities. In 2009, he moved to Massachusetts to start a dream restaurant with his friends.
