During my PhD I developed the following tools/flows: \n \n1) CNG: A Control Network Generator. A proven algorithm, and a CAD tool, that given required register-to-register data communications in a normally clocked system, will automatically generate a control network of the corresponding LI design. The generated control network is proven to utilize the minimum total number of control steering units (i.e., joins and forks). Thus, reducing area and power. The tool is readily applicable to both synchronous (e.g., synchronous elastic) and asynchronous (e.g., desynchronized) latency insensitive designs. \n \nTwo other tools were developed. Details are omitted since the contents were submitted for blind review.
