Verification Engineer IBM March 2007  \u2013  July 2010  (3 years 5 months) Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina Area Led a team to verify a next generation massively parellel processor interconnect chip utilizing IBM\u2019s best of breed simulation toolset. Methodology is based on constrained random simulation utilizing functional coverage to assist in determing simulation holes, complemented with formal verification (model-checking) on areas where it is applicable. Re-use is a must where low level object are promoted to higher levels of simulation. Primary duties include project management (status reporting, bug tracking, RIT closure, etc), hardware verification, methodolgy definition and rework, and assisting overall verification team. IBM\u2019s internal toolset includes a C++ library similar to System C that interfaces to a propietary cycle based simulator. Assisted the development teams in defining and integrating PSL into it, implementing better functional coverage infrastructure, and a new API to access arrays in the RTL (access from a logical sense not physical). Required working with research and development from IBM Haifa Reseach Center.
