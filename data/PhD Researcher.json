There has been an explosion in the discovery of functional and non-coding RNA molecules, as well as sophisticated systems (such as RNAi/CRISPR) to regulate the lifetimes and functions of these molecules. My project in Dan Herschlag's lab is to create a predictive model for how these RNA molecules fold to form intricate 3-dimensional shapes in order to function. This model is based on the energetics of individual parts of the molecules that can be 'added' together to predictive the stability of different conformations of the RNA.  \n \nI am also very interested in how the kinetic behaviors of enzymes has implications for in vivo function, specifically related to the Argonaute and Cas9 proteins.

I hope to apply and modify these techniques to study other nanostructural materials systems in an interdisciplinary field, such as one involving graphene- and spintronics-based devices. \n \nMy expertise lies with characterization of device structures at the nanoscale: During my PhD research, I analysed magnetic nanoparticles chemical and physical properties for their utilization in computer memory devices using techniques employing the TEM, SEM, SPM, and XPS. I used high resolution electron microscopy to show the structutal agreement of two polycrystalline thin films in a multilayer device. I was able to show the true amorphous atomic structure of the intergranular phase (IP) in the magnetic layer of these devices. We revealed atomic structural features within the IP of critical effects on the device performance quality factors. These results ultimately help in producing the hard disk drives with increased data storage densities. The work resulting from analyzing the samples was regularly communicated with Western Digital Corp., the funding source of my work, and some were submitted for publication. I was the top student during the masters program and acted as teaching assistant in various classes offered in the department. During summer sessions, I trained undergraduate students conduct research and produce reports from their work in my field of expertise who are now in their PhD programs at top universities. \n Summary In the course of my PhD research, I was able to develop various nanocharacterization techniques to analyze key structural aspects of magnetic recording media.

I was the top student during the masters program and acted as teaching assistant in various classes offered in the department. During summer sessions, I trained undergraduate students conduct research and produce reports from their work in my field of expertise who are now in their PhD programs at top universities. \n In the course of my PhD research, I was able to develop various nanocharacterization techniques to analyze key structural aspects of magnetic recording media. I hope to apply and modify these techniques to study other nanostructural materials systems in an interdisciplinary field, such as one involving graphene- and spintronics-based devices. \n \nMy expertise lies with characterization of device structures at the nanoscale: During my PhD research, I analysed magnetic nanoparticles chemical and physical properties for their utilization in computer memory devices using techniques employing the TEM, SEM, SPM, and XPS. I used high resolution electron microscopy to show the structutal agreement of two polycrystalline thin films in a multilayer device. I was able to show the true amorphous atomic structure of the intergranular phase (IP) in the magnetic layer of these devices. We revealed atomic structural features within the IP of critical effects on the device performance quality factors. These results ultimately help in producing the hard disk drives with increased data storage densities. The work resulting from analyzing the samples was regularly communicated with Western Digital Corp., the funding source of my work, and some were submitted for publication.
