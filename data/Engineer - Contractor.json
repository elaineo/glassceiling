Sr. Test Automation Engineer UTi WORLDWIDE July 2013  \u2013  January 2014  (7 months) Portland, OR As the Senior Test Automation Engineer for the Enterprise IT Quality Services team, I was responsible for the design and implementation of a scalable, reusable, and comprehensive automation framework for the UTi 1View enterprise application suite. I defined the automated test strategy, defined coding and process standards, and I drove the effort to integrate automated functional testing with a continuous integration build and deployment process. \n \nI drove the transition from using the HP QTP/UFT test automation tool to a more cost-effective and robust development and deployment model using SmartBear TestComplete for development of automated test suites, and low cost SmartBear TestExecute runtime licenses on multiple virtual machines for parallel and distributed test execution. \n \nThe TestCentricity\u2122 Core Generic Test Automation Framework Script Extension that I developed was used in conjunction with TestComplete/TestExecute to support rapid development and high productivity, and provides a full-featured library of methods designed to create robust and powerful data-driven test scripts. Sr. Software Test Automation Architect GE HEALTHCARE January 2008  \u2013  July 2013  (5 years 7 months) Hillsboro, OR I was responsible for the design, development, and deployment of automated test suites and supporting frameworks for the Centricity Electronic Medical Record and Revenue Cycle Management applications, as well as the Centricity desktop and mobile access client for EMR applications. I defined the automation strategy and developed the framework architecture, coding standards, test data assets, process guidelines, and training materials used by a team of 6 geographically dispersed test automation developers. \n \nWorking in an Agile development environment, I successfully designed and deployed multiple unmanned automated testing solutions that were coupled to the Hudson continuous integration build environments for multiple ongoing Centricity projects in Hillsboro OR, Plano TX, and Bangalore IN. \n \nI ported the generic and application specific frameworks that I originally developed for HP QTP to work with the SmartBear TestComplete/TestExecute automated test tool. This transition to automated test development using TestComplete and the TestCentricity\u2122 Core Generic Test Automation Framework Script Extension was made to provide more robust and comprehensive validation and verification of the new WPF and .Net 4 user interface for the desktop client versions of the EMR and Practice Management applications. I also updated the automation framework to support testing of a mobile EMR client Rich Internet Application built using Google Web Toolkit (GWT) and Ext GWT UI widgets. \n \nI defined the roles and responsibilities for test automation team members, participated in the interviewing and selection of team candidates, conducted group and individualized training sessions for team members, and contributed to the performance reviews of team members. \n \nI attended the STARWest 2011 Conference and participated in test automation development and mobile application test automation workshops. Sr. Software Test Automation Architect NIKE, INC. February 2005  \u2013  January 2008  (3 years) Beaverton, OR As test automation project lead and framework architect, I was responsible for the design, development, and documentation of automated testing solutions for the order capture, order status, and eCatalog data management components of Nike\u2019s retailer-facing global B2B applications.  \n \nUsing HP/Mercury QuickTest Pro and the TestCentricity\u2122 Core Generic Test Automation Framework, I developed a robust automation framework and data-driven test scripts used to perform build validation, functional, and regression testing of globalized Nike.net Order Management application releases covering over 50 languages/locales in the US, EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Americas regions. \n \nI formed the Test Automation Center of Excellence to share best practices, coding standards, and framework components with other software QA teams at Nike.
