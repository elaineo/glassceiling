Director, Information Processing Technology Office DARPA June 2002  \u2013  August 2005  (3 years 3 months) I ran DARPA's key computer/information science office, reporting to the director of the agency. In the 1960's, IPTO was the office out of which Computer Science was born, and the office that created the ARPANet and the Internet. During my tenure, our office budget increased to approx. $300M per year, covering multiple programs across the spectrum of Computer Science. I was responsible for creating a new Cognitive Systems agenda across the agency, and was the main driver behind the Personalized System that Learns (PAL) program; in that program I conceived an intelligent software assistant that communicated in natural language, planned, recognized plans and intentions, and learned in multiple ways. The PAL program led directly to the technology that is now in Apple's Siri. During my tenure at DARPA I briefed generals and admirals from all of our military services, and defended our budget with Congressional staffers.

Director, Information Processing Technology Office DARPA June 2002  \u2013  August 2005  (3 years 3 months) I ran DARPA's key computer/information science office, reporting to the director of the agency. In the 1960's, IPTO was the office out of which Computer Science was born, and the office that created the ARPANet and the Internet. During my tenure, our office budget increased to approx. $300M per year, covering multiple programs across the spectrum of Computer Science. I was responsible for creating a new Cognitive Systems agenda across the agency, and was the main driver behind the Personalized System that Learns (PAL) program; in that program I conceived an intelligent software assistant that communicated in natural language, planned, recognized plans and intentions, and learned in multiple ways. The PAL program led directly to the technology that is now in Apple's Siri. During my tenure at DARPA I briefed generals and admirals from all of our military services, and defended our budget with Congressional staffers.

Prior to joining Yahoo Labs, I was a research assistant in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Lehigh University, where I was a member of WUME lab from 2008 to 2013, under the supervision of Associate Professor Brian D. Davison. I obtained Ph.D. (2013), M.S. (2010) from Lehigh University and B.S. (2007) from Beijing University of Chemical Technology, all in Computer Science. \n \nMy research interests include: \n \n* machine learning and data mining \n* personalization and recommender systems \n* information retrieval and text mining \n \nWith the tools in the above areas, I focus on the applications in topic/interests modeling, recommendation/personalized information systems , collaborative filtering, user modeling/profiling and real-time event/trend detection. \n \nI have published papers in major international conferences in data mining, machine learning and information retrieval, such as SIGIR, WWW, KDD, CIKM, RecSys, AAAI, WSDM and ICML with more than 1,000 citations. I have been served as program committee members in SIGIR, WSDM, AAAI, EMNLP, ICWSM and several workshops. I have helped to review articles in journals such as Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, Neurocomputing, IEEE Intelligent Systems, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Journal of Computer Science and Technology, Journal of Systems Science and Systems Engineering and Information Systems.

In this paper we propose a hierarchical model and a scalable algorithm to perform inference for multitask learning. It infers task correlation and subtask structure in a joint sparse setting.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland and a BSc. in Computer Science fro the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown (ITB), Dublin, Ireland.  \n \nBroadly speaking my research interests involve understanding mobile users, their online, offline and on-device behaviors and interactions using a range of qualitative and quantitative research methods. I've spent 11+ years focused on all things mobile --- up to now, the majority of this work has been characterizing, understanding and enriching mobile search behaviors, mobile information access trends and mobile app usage patterns. I've done lots of work which explores how people access and consume mobile content, the types of daily information needs mobile user encounter, the effect of contextual cues on mobile behaviors as well as prototyping and evaluating proactive mobile and social applications that aim to enrich their experiences. \n \nI've experience in designing and carrying out live mobile field studies, combining quantitative and qualitative approaches; rapid mobile prototyping and development (mostly Java); and analyzing/ mining large-scale mobile user behavioral patterns. My research is varied and involves elements of design, prototyping/development, data mining & analysis and HCI, which is why I love it so much :) \n \nMore information about my research and publications can be found at www.karenchurch.com Summary I am a Senior Research Scientist with Yahoo!
