We named it Miracle Studio because we are the ones who believe miracle! (actually it is a combination of Microsoft and Oracle :). It is a group of enthusiastic students who are full of passion for computer science and technologies. Although miracles didn't visit us often, we had lots of unforgettable time together, discussing lastest computer technologies, creating website Lighteyes.net, meeting for brain storms, programming, traveling, and so on. It had been a precious memory in our campus life for all of us. Now the studio still exists in SCU.

The goal is achieved by applying different techniques adapted from natural language processing and machine learning areas.  \n\u2022\tDesigned and implemented product attributes extraction pipeline. The ultimate goal of the attribute project is to have a complete list of attributes (along with all the possible values of each attribute) for each noun. Then based on such comprehensive information, given a product, we have successfully recognized many attributes for each product by applying various information extraction techniques. After the attributes of a product properly identified, we have a better idea of what the product is and improved noun recognition, text classification, indexing and search relevancy.

More specifically,  \n\u2022\tDesigned and implemented product nouns recognition pipeline. It identifies the proper product noun from the title and description of a product. The goal is achieved by applying different techniques adapted from natural language processing and machine learning areas.  \n\u2022\tDesigned and implemented product attributes extraction pipeline. The ultimate goal of the attribute project is to have a complete list of attributes (along with all the possible values of each attribute) for each noun. Then based on such comprehensive information, given a product, we have successfully recognized many attributes for each product by applying various information extraction techniques. After the attributes of a product properly identified, we have a better idea of what the product is and improved noun recognition, text classification, indexing and search relevancy.
