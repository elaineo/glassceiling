Honors & Awards Qkly - Avoid Boring Queues Winner of the First Edition Innova Challenge Big Data by BBVA Bank December 2013 WHAT IS IT? \nHow many times did you get stuck in the queue at a supermarket or at a grocery store? How do you feel to go shopping during the sales period? And when you're visiting some attractions or museums? Have you ever wondered if there is a way in which you could have avoided it? \n \nQkly automatically produces optimized schedules of all the business, attractions, or places based on your preferences. Using historical data provided by the BBVA Open API, Qkly is able to estimate how crowded a place is at a certain time. Based on this information, it helps you to pick the time in which less people are present, so as to save time and avoid stress. \n \nWebsite: \nhttp://grupoweb.upf.edu/innova/q_kly/ \n \nGoogle Play App: \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.q_kly \n \nAward: \nhttps://www.centrodeinnovacionbbva.com/en/pages/29293-winners Quartz 2nd Winner of the First Edition Innova Challenge Big Data by BBVA Bank December 2013 THE INTERFACE \nQuartz allows you to explore how people spend their money.

If you move the mouse on a segment of the wheel, you can see the number of payments in the center. Also, you can see additional segments on the wheel representing how the payments in the category distribute in sub-segments. If you move from a segment to one of its sub-segment, you will see the percentage of payments in the segment which refer to it, as well as the percentage on the total amount for the location. \n \nWebsite: \nhttp://grupoweb.upf.edu/innova/quartz3d/ \n \nAward: \nhttps://www.centrodeinnovacionbbva.com/en/pages/29293-winnersless Best Paper Runner-up ICMR2013 April 2013 Michele Trevisiol, Guillaume Gravier, Jonathan Delhumeau, Herve\u0301 Je\u0301gou,  \n\u201cRetrieving geo-location of videos with a divide & conquer hierarchical multimodal approach\u201d,  \nApril 16 \u2013 19, Dallas, Texas (USA), 2013, [Best Paper Runner-up]  \nACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval, ICMR2013 Qkly - Avoid Boring Queues Winner of the First Edition Innova Challenge Big Data by BBVA Bank December 2013 WHAT IS IT? \nHow many times did you get stuck in the queue at a supermarket or at a grocery store?
