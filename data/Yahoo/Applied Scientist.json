Principal Software Development Engineer, Skype Microsoft October 2011  \u2013  June 2014  (2 years 9 months) Palo Alto, CA Next generation services for Skype, based on cloud architecture. \n \nMy key contributions included: \n \n- Trouter: large scale web notification service implemented fully in node.js, and deployed on Windows Azure. It uses socket.io to handle comet and websocket communication. I created an early prototype of the service and then followed through in architecture and software development leading to production release. I co-authored a patent application based on this work. \n \n- Sharks: library for combining together several key-value stores hosted in different data centers in order to create a composite, replicated key-value store of higher reliability, surviving outages of individual data centers. Worked on interesting synchronization properties, better than eventual consistency, under mild quorum write & read assumptions. Developed in C#, using async-await framework.

Chief Software Architect, Skype Enterprise Skype September 2010  \u2013  October 2011  (1 year 2 months) Palo Alto, CA Web collaboration software for enterprises. \n \nMy main accomplishment: defining architecture of a hybrid web and native client for Skype Enterprise. The client aimed to bridge the legacy Skype peer to peer architecture with next generation cloud architecture. Much of the complexity and finesse was in arranging inter-working between web and native domains of the client to meet various requirements that go beyond the needs of standard web applications. I authored two patent applications based on this work. Software Architect, Reuters Messaging Thomson Reuters September 2006  \u2013  August 2010  (4 years) New York City, NY Web collaboration software for financial industry. \n \nMy main accomplishment: creating a next generation communication platform for Reuters Messaging. It was called Web Collaboration Platform and it was a radical departure from and modernization of the legacy architecture of Reuters Messaging based on SIP and Microsoft Lync platform. Distinguishing features of the Web Collaboration Platform included: single unifying abstraction of a collaboration channel, focus on HTTP web services, web friendly JSON data format, real time web notifications using a dedicated web push service based on comet, open source components, primarily Java jetty. Above all, the architecture addressed an intersection of synchronous and asynchronous modes of messaging, unifying traditionally separate applications of Instant Messaging and persistent chat rooms under one roof. I defined architecture of this new technology, and worked with a small team on developing it and deploying at Reuters Messaging as a complement and in many instances a replacement of the legacy SIP / Lync architecture. WCP currently carries a traffic load on the same level as the original legacy platform. \n \nI also contributed as architect to other projects at Reuters Messaging, including web messenger (AJAX, web services accessed via XHR, comet), integration of web messenger with Thomson Reuters trading platforms (Single Sign On among other requirements), and compliance service for Reuters Messaging. Senior Software Engineer Telcordia Technologies 1999  \u2013  2006  (7 years) piscataway, nj Telecommunication systems software, Internet communication software. \n \nI worked in a technology incubation team, developing software prototypes for new telecommunication products of Telcordia. The example contributions included: \n \n- Architecture and a corresponding software prototype for Converged Communication Services, a Java web services platform that allows building various applications on top of PSTN, such as a TV telecom portal, an application executing in a TV set top box. It offered features such as TV caller ID, call logs, click to call, interactive call routing using a TV remote etc. \n \n- Services controlling dual mode WiFi and cellular phones. The service handled registration on either network, and seamless mid-call hand-offs between the networks, based on the strength of the signal. This technology was based on Java and SIP servlets.  \n \n- Web application allowing a quick transition from a phone call to a web conference. I received a US patent for the idea, as a co-author. \n \n- Enhanced services on top of Telcordia MGCP-based softswitch. \n \n- Enterprise broadcast application, using web services combined with IP multicast, based on .NET and Windows Media Services.
