This included lectures, workshops, study visits etc. Main tasks included organizing the events and contacting companies interested in participating at CHARM. In addition to this I was responsible for a new technology exhibit named \"CHARMtech\" for CHARM2015. I also supervised three members from the Project Group as well as several hosts during the fair.
