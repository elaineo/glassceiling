Senior Research Scientist Yahoo! January 2011  \u2013  May 2012  (1 year 5 months) - Measuring Impacts on User Engagement: I led this project in which we developed a system to measure the impact of user-experience changes on long-term engagement of users. Our emphasis was on deriving causal links relying mainly on pre-existing (observational) log-data; i.e. without having to run randomized experiments. The first study quantitatively characterized the impact of spam-exposure on long-term user-engagement. \n- Modeling Social Systems: I extensively researched social system dynamics: modeling the reasons why users link to each other, the propagation of trends, and the production of content on social systems. \n- Mining Hidden User Intent: I worked extensively on modeling the observed behavior of users to mine their hidden intents. This work resulted in systems to help determine the user intent in ambiguous web search queries (mining facets), in computational advertising systems (commercial intent in queries), and social systems (the reason behind linking). \n- Web Search Systems: I worked on many layers of the web-search technology stack: from devising low-level indexing and early-termination optimizations all the way up to improving the display of search results (summarizing tweets, shortening page-titles, generating quicklinks and query-suggestions, etc.) \n- Abuse Detection and Prevention: In this long-running project I developed systems for mail- spam detection, detection and prevention of phishing, design and stress-tests of CAPTCHAs, and data mining of logs to detect abusive behavior.

Work on aggregated search won best paper awards at the SIGIR 2009, WSDM 2010, and ECIR 2011 conferences. Work on crisis-related information access was nominated for best paper at SIGIR 2011. Post-doctoral fellow UCLA Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics September 2007  \u2013  December 2007  (4 months) Participated in the \"Search Engines\" program. Research Assitant Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval September 2001  \u2013  August 2007  (6 years) My dissertation research currently focuses on black-box methods for improving information retrieval systems. I have designed an algorithm which significantly improves the performance of arbitrary retrieval systems in a variety of settings. The generality of this algorithm means that the result is significant for all areas of information retrieval. In addition to this empirical result, I have drawn deep theoretical connections to classic information retrieval techniques. Other results include the development of a robust measure for predicting the quality of an arbitrary document ranking and the design of an algorithm for topically aligning multilingual corpora without translation dictionaries.
