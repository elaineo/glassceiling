Experience Sr. Solutions Architect TSA / Homeland Security November 2014  \u2013 Present (10 months) Arlington, VA (HQ) I am responsible for serving a cross between a technical architect and part of an oversight committee that reviews all technical changes that are to occur, new deployments, technical challenge and all other issues that may arise and will affect the end client. It is my responsibility to review all storage and backup and recovery requests and submit my input for approval for changes that need to be made before the process can be approved and implemented to the customer\u2019s environment. If I notice a better way to architect a new deployment, resolve a current or ongoing issue, laying out a technical design to be deployed, I am responsible for reviewing these issues and proposals, and after careful review, either propose a different solution, recommend a different approach to a good solution, or deny a plan or approach with reasoning as to why. I must stay up on all technical storage and backup hardware and software technologies in order to serve my team and Homeland security to the best of my abilities. Technical Architect Humana April 2014  \u2013  September 2014  (6 months) WFH Waldorf, MD / Louisville, KY Serving as the Technical Architect, it is my responsibility to report directly to management with solutions that will address current and future needs whether that is a hardware in EMC, IBM, Flash technologies other additional storage vendors such as NetApp, HDS, 3PAR as well as looking at different solutions such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) which Humana is currently doing a proof of concept (POC) or other software solutions. While looking at all the needs within Humana and the vast array of hardware onsite such as block or file storage arrays (VMax, VPlex, Isilon, Centerra, VNX file/Block, DataDomain, IBM DS8870, FLASH technology (Pure Storage, Violin, EMC XtremIO, IBM TM), SRM tools (EMC ViPR SRM, IBM TPC, and many other 3rd party vendor SRM monitoring tools and technologies. It is my responsibility to search for new technologies that will address these needs and trends along with trying to keep within the budget guidelines and constraints. It is my responsibility to manage and set up meetings and demonstrations with vendors to explore the capabilities of the hardware or software product and relate this information to how this solution will benefit Humana\u2019s needs. A determination is made after the data gathering is complete, and if the solution addresses the prior set requirements and is deemed a viable solution worth pursuing, additional meetings will be scheduled and additional internal resources will be brought in for review further. Engaging with and working very closely with our internal and external customers and vendors to build ongoing relationships to leverage those relationships in a professional manner in order to better serve Humana to provide the solutions that address our storage and productivity requirements. Sr. Solutions Architect Global Science & Technologies / NOAA March 2010  \u2013  April 2014  (4 years 2 months) This was a very exciting position and time with GST/NOAA. Upon coming onboard, NOAA had just upgraded their storage environment to 15 new EMC Clariion Storage Arrays (2PB). There was a prior situation that occurred before my coming onboard, NOAA was behind schedule and really needed someone who could come on board and hit the ground running in order to ensure these arrays were ready to ingest daily data requirements from multiple satellites.I was able to meet with both management and administrators to gain pertinent knowledge on each file system in order to better aid me in how best to structure each file system, RAID levels, along with different levels of tiering, zoning and port assignments. \nDuring this time, I provided upper management with historical analysis on each arrays capacity and performance and resolve any issues that arose. There were many times that I was called upon to perform large data migrations either to consolidate, reduce data center foot print and resources. I was very successful in the designing, architecting and migrating large amounts of data with no impact or downtime to any of our environments using various tools to accomplish this.Seeing as government funding was limited, I was constantly searching for ways to save and cut costs. One of those projects saved NOAA over $1.6M in annual maintenance costs on hardware. Over the years, I met with EMC & NetApp regularly to discuss new technologies that could be brought into NOAA. After some careful planning and working with the vendors on budget restraints we had before us, I was able to help bring in NetApp filers, VNX/VNXe arrays and Isilon. Sr. Solutions Architect EMC November 2008  \u2013  November 2009  (1 year 1 month) Reston, VA Being the lead Clariion Replication Manager Matter expert, I managed over 300 replication manager jobs successfully, took their success rate from 40% up to 97%.

Provisioning storage out to other departments within Cisco, along with SRDF redundancy, Clariion Replication Manager, Powerpath, along with managing a small team of 12 people. I excelled very well at this position, but because of outside circumstances, another position came along that I decided would be a better fit for the longer term. Sr. Solutions Architect Hilton \u2013 EMC (Contract) May 2008  \u2013  August 2008  (4 months) Memphis, TN Being the lead architect for multiple Data migrations, consolidations and repurpose as this clients lease time was expiring from 10 Clariion CX 700\u2019s and down to only 5 CX3-80\u2019s, with additional servers being added, it was key to design scripts to automate SnapView for Indexing servers with received information from the master server along with the scripting for creating and decommissioning on the customers 4 Cisco MDS 9513\u2019s. Other responsibilities were automating MirrorView using replication manager and scheduling clones for disaster recovery. Hilton had a variety of operating systems such as AIX, Solaris, Windows and VMware.

I became so good at this, that what should of taken a week to complete, I was able to do in two days. If any issues arose, I was the go to person to go and resolve any issues that happened in the field, which I had a very high success rate at this. On one issue, I flew out at 10am in the morning with nothing but my computer, landed in LA, went directly to the client site, and for 3 days straight I never left, had conference calls, webex sessions, and after 63 hours of non stop working, we resolved the issue. I never checked into my hotel room, just went straight back to the airport and caught a red eye home.

Sr. Solutions Architect Global Science & Technologies / NOAA March 2010  \u2013  April 2014  (4 years 2 months) This was a very exciting position and time with GST/NOAA. Upon coming onboard, NOAA had just upgraded their storage environment to 15 new EMC Clariion Storage Arrays (2PB). There was a prior situation that occurred before my coming onboard, NOAA was behind schedule and really needed someone who could come on board and hit the ground running in order to ensure these arrays were ready to ingest daily data requirements from multiple satellites.I was able to meet with both management and administrators to gain pertinent knowledge on each file system in order to better aid me in how best to structure each file system, RAID levels, along with different levels of tiering, zoning and port assignments. \nDuring this time, I provided upper management with historical analysis on each arrays capacity and performance and resolve any issues that arose. There were many times that I was called upon to perform large data migrations either to consolidate, reduce data center foot print and resources. I was very successful in the designing, architecting and migrating large amounts of data with no impact or downtime to any of our environments using various tools to accomplish this.Seeing as government funding was limited, I was constantly searching for ways to save and cut costs. One of those projects saved NOAA over $1.6M in annual maintenance costs on hardware. Over the years, I met with EMC & NetApp regularly to discuss new technologies that could be brought into NOAA. After some careful planning and working with the vendors on budget restraints we had before us, I was able to help bring in NetApp filers, VNX/VNXe arrays and Isilon.

On one issue, I flew out at 10am in the morning with nothing but my computer, landed in LA, went directly to the client site, and for 3 days straight I never left, had conference calls, webex sessions, and after 63 hours of non stop working, we resolved the issue. I never checked into my hotel room, just went straight back to the airport and caught a red eye home.
