testing towards development work in these fields. During my time at Coupons.com, I ensured the proper rendering of Coupons.com's Facebook coupon application (Brandcaster), allowing various stores to distribute their coupons through Facebook. This allowed me to gain a good understanding of front end development, including xPath, cookies, iframes, and web delivery. I also validated the PCI compliance of Coupons.com's credit card coupon system (CLOE), allowing for customers to securely use their coupons with their credit cards at local grocery stores. Here, I learned about multi-layer interactions between application and data access layers through the use of MySQL and JDBC. At Yahoo!, I enabled the proper categorization of queries to Yahoo's advertising service, improving the relevance of Yahoo's advertisements to end users. My project taught me much about modular development, as I had to ensure fluid integration of my code with code from my fellow developers. But as part of understanding the impact, I have to process the various adserving logs and do performance analysis - something very much in line with my major in bioinfomatics. During my second year at Yahoo!, I returned to help develop an autonomous reporting system for Yahoo!'s advertising service. So far, I have added the ability to access previous records through an existing monitoring UI, and created a summary page to greatly help the reporting team monitor all pipelines. I had to create my own webpages and create custom endpoint queries, increasing the productivity of the reporting team so that Yahoo! Gemini can better adjust their adverting platform to today's market. I am proud of my ability to improve customer satisfaction through my development work, as well as excited about learning about bleeding edge technology actually used in the real world, not only taught in the classroom.
