Responsible for delivering Demandware's next generation analytics platform. System allows companies on Demandware to measure their KPI performance against an anonymous aggregated data set of other customers within the same retail vertical. Modeled a large snowflake schema representing visitors, visits, promotions, searches, orders, products across a wide variety of dimensions. Every 2 hours, 12 GB of data is transformed from web logs using Hadoop. Data is further transformed through a multi-process workflow, using Spring Batch and Oracle. Also, built a prototype using HBase. System uses S3, EMR, EC2, SQS, SNS and RDS from Amazon AWS Principal Software Engineer Demandware November 2010  \u2013  June 2012  (1 year 8 months) Re-architected Demandware\u2019s Active Merchandising solution, saving over 2 million dollars a year. Active Merchandising dynamically changes web sites behavior based on prior trends and targeting rules. Also, custom promotions rules to target specific customer groups are created and driven dynamically by the data. Replaced Adobe Omniture with a custom implementation using Apache Hadoop running Amazon\u2019s AWS infrastructure. System processes over 3 TB of data per night, for all customers across the globe. Responsible for monitoring the system daily and diagnosing all production issues raised by support.  \n \nAlso was a full time member of the cloud infrastructure team responsible many of the next generation cloud architecture pieces including: messaging, distributed databases, performance measurement, and health monitoring Senior Enterprise Architect PAREXEL April 2010  \u2013  October 2010  (7 months) Principal Architect POC'd a new clinical trials management system. The system will replace an existing 1 million line legacy system in development for the past 15 years. The front end will be built using the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) framework. Server-side business logic is built on top of Spring 3.X and Hibernate 3.X. The system will also integrate with 15 legacy systems within PAREXEL. Principal Technical Architect Collaborative Consulting February 2006  \u2013  April 2010  (4 years 3 months) Technical architect for 5 high profile projects for Collaborative Consulting. All projects exceeded client expectations and in each case resulted in additional work being purchased. Acted as the principal developer on each project, often leading a small team as well.  \n \nIn house projects included the development of JTrace. Conceived and developed to reverse engineer any Java based application using AspectJ. Only one command line option was needed to instrument the JVM. Business transactions are mapped transparently as a request travels through one or more application tiers. A button click from the UI resulted in reports generated that showed all execution paths across all tiers. JTrace reconstructed the execution flow back into hierarchal XML structure used for reporting. In addition any JDBC, JMS, JTA, Servlet, EJB, Socket, Thread, etc\u2026 was also collected in context. Custom reports based on the clients needs are created from the data collected. This was successfully applied to RxConnect resulting in a holistic view of the RxConnect application. Key architectural improvements were easily identified. Principal Technical Architect Retail Convergence for Collaborative Consulting January 2010  \u2013  March 2010  (3 months) Architected and single-handedly wrote a custom UI used to monitor the ESB that integrates Retail Convergence and GSI. From the UI, administrators can change workflow steps, generate custom reports, monitor requests and trigger complex reposts back into the ESB. Dashboards provide real time insight into the performance of the system. The front end is written in GWT. Server-side business logic is written in Groovy using a custom high level DSL. Backend systems are monitored using JMX. Alerts to third party systems are triggered using a complex event processing framework called Esper. Performance Architect CVS Corporation \u2013 RxConnect for Collaborative Consulting January 2008  \u2013  December 2009  (2 years) CVS is replacing their core pharmacy system. The new pharmacy system is a custom 3 million line Java application, consisting of over 500 Weblogic instances and a 28 terabyte database. The system will handle 68 billion dollars worth of drug fills a year across 7,000 stores nationwide. The application runs each store as well as all the calculations at central. My role was to redesign core pieces to improve scalability and time to market. Changes included a twenty fold increase in performance of the number of prescription fills per second, security model, caching, queue refresh, central sync, heartbeat and reconciliation processes. Each change often touched major pieces of a very complex application. Backward compatibility is paramount because stores are upgraded at different times. Wrote implementations demonstrating the increased scalability and performance. Diagnosed major issues impeding the progress of performance testing. Identified bugs in both IBM\u2019s JVM and Oracle\u2019s JDBC drivers. My work in this role resulted in the expansion of the team from 4 consultants to 30 within one year. Technical Architect Blue Cross Blue Shield of MA \u2013 Behavioral Heath Outcomes for Collaborative Consulting April 2007  \u2013  November 2007  (8 months) Architected enterprise wide SOA security model for partners accessing web services from external partners. Designed the model, presented it for approval to the clients architecture team, which included creation of use cases and technical design documents (using established OOA/OOD principals); design of a new directory structure for LDAP; Sun\u2019s Access Manager configuration and roles definition; and custom web service security policies for handling message level signing and encryption using an ESB. Technical Architect Blue Cross Blue Shield of MA \u2013 Member Portal for Collaborative Consulting May 2006  \u2013  November 2007  (1 year 7 months) Led a small team of developers in the definition of the company\u2019s SOA architecture and the construction of 65 custom and reusable web services. The services provided the backbone for the next iteration of bluecrossma.com self service application. The services covered fourteen functional areas including viewing Claims, Benefits, Deductibles, Referrals, and User Management. Users were also capable of retrieving new ID cards, updating their address and PCP information. An ESB was extended to support a custom security model. Services communicated to the mainframe systems through SeeBeyond messaging. An existing registration schema was extended to support registering members to LDAP and Oracle. Four custom SSO\u2019s to external partners were developed using both preparatory schemes as well as SAML. Maven was introduced to automate the build process. Technical Lead Iron Mountain \u2013 Automated Data Restoration for Collaborative Consulting March 2006  \u2013  June 2006  (4 months) Technical lead on a project to automate a manual data restoration process. The process restored assets from tapes and made them available online. The SOA style of architecture leveraged TIBCO as a workflow engine to coordinate the activities across multiple types of systems and servers distributed across two separate datacenters. Messaging was used to communicate with the servers. A console application was built to administer the system. Both Oracle and SQL Server database instances were updated and reported on. Technical Lead Monitor August 2004  \u2013  January 2006  (1 year 6 months) As the technical lead for 5 major projects, guided 3 to 7 colleagues from inception through deployment. Responsibilities included producing architectural diagrams, designing project plans and implementing designs.  \n \nGalapagos  \n\u2022\tUsing a custom designed, genetic algorithm engine, architected a complex financial trading system which evolves computer programs to predict future market trends. \n\u2022\tPrograms are randomly generated by the computer program and traded within a virtual stock market for a given time period.

Principal Technical Architect Collaborative Consulting February 2006  \u2013  April 2010  (4 years 3 months) Technical architect for 5 high profile projects for Collaborative Consulting. All projects exceeded client expectations and in each case resulted in additional work being purchased. Acted as the principal developer on each project, often leading a small team as well.  \n \nIn house projects included the development of JTrace. Conceived and developed to reverse engineer any Java based application using AspectJ. Only one command line option was needed to instrument the JVM. Business transactions are mapped transparently as a request travels through one or more application tiers. A button click from the UI resulted in reports generated that showed all execution paths across all tiers. JTrace reconstructed the execution flow back into hierarchal XML structure used for reporting. In addition any JDBC, JMS, JTA, Servlet, EJB, Socket, Thread, etc\u2026 was also collected in context. Custom reports based on the clients needs are created from the data collected. This was successfully applied to RxConnect resulting in a holistic view of the RxConnect application. Key architectural improvements were easily identified.

Performance Architect CVS Corporation \u2013 RxConnect for Collaborative Consulting January 2008  \u2013  December 2009  (2 years) CVS is replacing their core pharmacy system. The new pharmacy system is a custom 3 million line Java application, consisting of over 500 Weblogic instances and a 28 terabyte database. The system will handle 68 billion dollars worth of drug fills a year across 7,000 stores nationwide. The application runs each store as well as all the calculations at central. My role was to redesign core pieces to improve scalability and time to market. Changes included a twenty fold increase in performance of the number of prescription fills per second, security model, caching, queue refresh, central sync, heartbeat and reconciliation processes. Each change often touched major pieces of a very complex application. Backward compatibility is paramount because stores are upgraded at different times. Wrote implementations demonstrating the increased scalability and performance. Diagnosed major issues impeding the progress of performance testing. Identified bugs in both IBM\u2019s JVM and Oracle\u2019s JDBC drivers. My work in this role resulted in the expansion of the team from 4 consultants to 30 within one year.
