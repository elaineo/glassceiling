Yahoo! February 2008  \u2013  November 2014  (6 years 10 months) San Diego CA Promoted in 2013 to Sr. Manager I now lead a team of systems engineers supporting several of Yahoo's largest and most critical platforms. Sr. Service Engineer Yahoo February 2008  \u2013  March 2012  (4 years 2 months) Greater San Diego Area I originally started at Yahoo as part of the Yahoo Music team. I was brought in to fix the ongoing stability issues with Music's Windows infrastructure. With my guidance we adopted a 'best practices' approach to systems management and code releases. I migrated the legacy NT 4.0 domain to 2003 Active Directory while eliminating all instances of Widows NT 4 and 2000 for added security / stability. Within a couple of months we had reduced the number of outages from several per week, to zero. Music became one of the most stable platforms at Yahoo because of this work. \n \nIn 2010 Music was moved under the Media umbrella and I became a member of the global Media Service Engineering team. In this role I was directly responsible for on-boarding new sites to the Yahoo Producer Platform which hosts over 400 Yahoo sites, serving daily peak traffic in excess of 70,000 RPS, and spans 6 data centers in 5 countries.
