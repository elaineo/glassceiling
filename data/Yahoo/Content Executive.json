Medical Advocate Medical Advocate for a Family Member (Parent) August 2005  \u2013  February 2009  (3 years 7 months) * Medical advocate for my mother as she suffered very grave medical conditions, starting with a pulmonary embolism in 8/05 and an anti-coagulation medication reaction in 9/05 that caused many complications. Details of our experiences (and battles) are in my blog: http://ellipsesinliving.blogspot.com/2007_01_01_archive.html \n* Managed my mother's care, life, transport ... anything she couldn't handle in her delicate state. Took control of aspects of her care with the Crash Team in the hospital's ER in 07/06, as the medical team didn't respond to signals she presented. \n* My mother lived until 02/09, finally succumbing to all of the various medical issues she had suffered. I took the things I'd internalized from this experience as her medical advocate into my next position. I reacted and responded to the pressures of her situation, having experienced the chaos of an ER with a crashing patient (which is a different level of pressure), especially when that patient is a loved one, my mother.
