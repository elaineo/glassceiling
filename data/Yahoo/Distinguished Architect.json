Also fixed code on servlet-based education platform to assist staff in self-registering for trainings. \n \nFor Enterprise Services IT Team\u2026 \n\u2022\tOnline Support Center: Crafted servlet-based application, bolstering 45,000 logins and 17,000 transactions per month\u2014accounting for 25% of all of Sun's service tickets. \n\u2022\tContracts Query Tool: Built web-based query tool to facilitate real-time contract searches\u2014still used today. Also designed single-source ancillary documents to accompany contracts. Senior Software Engineer Sun Microsystems September 1994  \u2013  April 1999  (4 years 8 months) Conceptualized, planned, and developed countless software systems focused primarily on assisting/automating Human Resources and client-facing Enterprise Services group. Recommended architecture options, approved Oracle database and schema designs, directed sub-teams of developers and consultants, and mentored engineers on code design. \n \nFor Workforce Resources IT Group\u2026 \n\u2022\tPerformance Tracking Application: Championed web-based J2EE-driven employee performance measurement system facilitating evaluation efforts for 100 HR staff through real-time data, easy-to-use screens, and a Brio reporting system.
