July 2013  \u2013 Present (2 years 2 months) Created an enhanced contact details screen/application for Yahoo Contacts, powered by Node.js/Express. The application federates calls to internal Yahoo services to produce rich contact details for selected contacts. The feature served as a pilot for Node.js use by Contacts as well as a nice enhancement to the product in and of itself; its success is prompting more Node.js development by the team. \n \nIn order to meet some new product requirements for mail search, I created a search autocomplete component for Yahoo mail's front end which federates multiple types of data across a variety of services which return their data asynchronously. The component is very flexible, supporting the ability to hook up data sources, renderers, and selection handlers from any number of data providers, all of whom can return their data at any time. Replaced the current, inflexible, hodge-podge solutions in mail supporting some subsets of this functionality, and refactored accordingly.  \n \nUsing Node.js/Express, I built a tool used by one of the editorial teams in Yahoo. The tool required reading from and writing to large files, so for performance reasons, it used Node's streaming APIs. \n \nCreated a web client (using jQuery) to help test, develop, and prove out a new search related project at Yahoo. The client was developed while working in tandem with engineers owning the server component to help prove out the model of what was needed for the project and to learn how best to structure the project's APIs. The client supports streaming responses via chunked transfer encoding. Software Engineer Xobni November 2009  \u2013  July 2013  (3 years 9 months) Worked on Xobni\u2019s generic out of box/on-boarding application. It's a flexible, rich web client backed by Node.js. It is used by several web and native mobile clients to walk users through our login, signup, and third-party OAuth flows. \n \nI was one of the lead developers for a Chrome/Firefox/Safari extension that integrates Xobni functionality with GMail (https://www.xobni.com/download/gmail). This is a single-page HTML5/Javascript application that uses Xobni's cloud API to fetch rich contact data to display as the user interacts with email messages in GMail. \n \nBuilt a CardDAV server for Xobni contacts in Node.js (on top of jsDAV). This allows the iPhone and OSX Address Book, for example, to sync locally a user's Xobni contacts without a special Xobni client. This is an ongoing pet project. \n \nBuilt an LDAP adapter for Xobni contacts in Node.js (on top of ldapjs). This allows the iPhone and other LDAP clients to perform LDAP directory searches against a user's Xobni contacts.  \n \nVarious nodejs/Express services to showcase Xobni's data. \n \nC#/.NET programming for the world's leading Outlook plugin, focusing particularly on the .NET/COM bridge, Win32 API hooks (e.g. subclassing Windows messages), and COM Addin support.

Software Engineer Gaia Online March 2008  \u2013  November 2009  (1 year 9 months) Senior Flex 3/ActionScript 3.0 developer for zOMG! \n \nI added many game features, but was particularly focused on optimization and efficiency issues (e.g. finding and fixing reasons for low frame rates and excessive garbage collection). \n \nI helped spearhead the project to retroactively add Flex to the game, and architected a new UI framework based on Flex modules. I also implemented several new and improved UI elements. \n \nI wrote the MMO's wrapper around AOL\u2019s ActionScript AIM API (wimas3), implementing chat over AIM for the game. \n \nGaia had no build process for its front-end applications when I joined, so I created a continuous integration system, back-porting several projects to use it, including zOMG! Senior Software Engineer Yahoo! June 2006  \u2013  March 2008  (1 year 10 months) Senior developer for a Flex 3/ActionScript 3.0 implementation of Y! Messenger for the Web \n \nI was one of the key architects and implementers of Yahoo!\u2019s web messenger product, built using ActionScript 3.0 and the Flex 3 framework. I also designed and built a continuous build system for the project. This product was spun off into JetBlue\u2019s instant messenger solution on its planes in flight. \n \nThe product was also spun off into myM, a web messenger product that integrated messages, wall posts, vitality information, etc. from Facebook, MySpace, and AIM. myM was released in beta internally and to some test groups with much acclaim, but Yahoo! shelved the product in early 2007 before releasing it to the general public. Staff Software Engineer Intuit February 2005  \u2013  June 2006  (1 year 5 months) Served as technical lead for a team of five regular (and sometimes as many as ten) developers refactoring the QuickBooks code base to remove the limits on the number of elements in a QuickBooks list (these are feature-level lists, such as the Customer List, Vendor List, Item List, etc.). Essentially, this involved changing a fundamental data type used in a very large codebase. Because the list subsystem and this data type permeated the codebase, the project had tremendous impact on the product and required changes to almost every major piece of functionality in QuickBooks (approximately 200,000 lines of code were changed across more than 20 modules); it also posed particular problems for serialization code and external (e.g. API) clients. The challenges in the project included rooting out what portions of the codebase (often old and undocumented) would be affected, figuring out how to change them, and helping to manage and coordinate a very large set of changes. \n \nCritical to the success of the project was my development of an instrumentation class to cause compilation errors in many places where we missed changing one of these fundamental data types. Lead Software Engineer FactSet Research Systems January 2004  \u2013  January 2005  (1 year 1 month) Lead architect and programmer for many solutions that integrated FactSet\u2019s data with Microsoft Office (Active Publishing Workstation (APW) and the FactSet-Excel Link), using C++, COM, ActiveX, Win32, DDE, Excel's binary file format, and VBA. \n \nAPW was FactSet\u2019s publishing solution, allowing users to populate and update Office documents with FactSet financial data; the FactSet-Excel Link allowed clients to integrate FactSet data into their spreadsheets in a myriad of ways, including the exporting server-based reports to Excel (using XML and HTML), providing custom worksheet functions to retrieve FactSet data, real-time updates in Excel cells (using DDE), and merging requested FactSet data into Excel files on disk by manipulating the Excel file format (BIFF). \n \nHelped spearhead FactSet\u2019s transition from multibyte to Unicode in its PC applications. Wrote the code to enable all the Office integration products and features to support Unicode. Senior Software Engineer, Lead Excel developer FactSet Research Systems October 2001  \u2013  January 2004  (2 years 4 months) Rearchitected FactSet's Excel spreadsheet updating functionality (called Data Downloading), replacing a difficult to maintain and to enhance algorithm involving file format manipulation with an algorithm based on OLE automation of Excel and HTML/XML/CSS. This enabled several important enhancements that were outstanding requests for many years. The process involved touching a great deal of low-level code and modifying FactSet's proprietary protocols for transmitting data. \n \nRearchitected FactSet's mechanism for exporting online reports to Excel, replacing a DDE-based mechanism with an XML/HTML/clipboard based one. Based on my architecture and leadership, FactSet is now able to export reports to PowerPoint presentations and to Word documents. \n \nImplemented linking of Excel cells populated with FactSet data to online documents from which the data was pulled, architecting a solution that uses a custom URL protocol and COM.

Lead Software Engineer, Yahoo Guaranteed Display Advertising system v2.0 Yahoo! Inc August 2008  \u2013  December 2011  (3 years 5 months) First engineer to join the GD 2.0 Serving system. Prototype, Design and build the Serving systems and algorithms for next generation of Yahoo!'s Guaranteed Display advertising platform (GD 2.0). \n \n* Ongoing Feature development for Yahoo's Next generation Display advertising serving system, in close collaboration with scientists, mathematicians, economists and research engineers from Yahoo! Research Labs and Applied sciences. The systems are build to handle Billions of Page views Per Day. \n \n* Built the first prototype for the GD2 Online Serving system, all the way from the first line of code for the first iteration of the production system. This system was launched in shadow mode in march 2009, taking tee'd off production traffic, for basic systemic/algorithmic analysis. The learnings were used in the next iteration of serving-systems development, which replaced the old system in may 2011 .  \n \n* Built the core algorithmic components for Indexing and Search infrastructure used to retrieve matching Ads for a given user-visit/query/page-view, with sub-millisecond index-lookup-latencies on search over a corpus of over several hundred-thousand documents in a single partition. Augmented the existing Index Serving infrastructure to accommodate the newly developed core indexing infrastructure, and reliable transport support for GD 2.0. The work was based on the following papers:  \n \n- \"Efficiently Evaluating Complex Boolean Expressions\", Marcus Fontoura, Suhas Sadanandan, Jayavel Shanmugasundaram, Sergei Vassilvitski, Erik Vee, Srihari Venkatesan, Jason Zien, SIGMOD 2010 \n \n- \"Indexing Boolean Expressions\", Steven Whang, Chad Brower, Jayavel.

Inc August 2008  \u2013  November 2008  (4 months) Yahoo!'s Guaranteed Delivery \"Classic\" backend infrastructure, which has been running for several years. \n \nBefore starting on building the next-generation of advertising system, it was important to understand the existing ad-serving system, and I started on this project. \n \nThe \"classic\" adserving system currently handles (globally) the online-serving of all of Yahoo's Guranteed Ad inventory, and contributes to Billion+ $$ in revenue (much of Yahoo's display ad revenue).  \n \nFiguring out and bug-fixing the core ad-selection and ad-scoring logic of the GD 1.0 adserver within 2 months of joining the team, amongst other enhancements and bug fixes. \n \nHelped the performance certification initiative by taking up performance testing and tuning of the GD 1.0 adserver for both Yahoo! Internal traffic (YAN) , and Yahoo Newspaper consortium (NC) traffic on the very first week of joining this team, and developed supporting scripts/tools for performance testing. The work helped towards adserver performance certification for for LZ 2.0 and 3.0 milestone-releases. Lead Software Engineer, Y! Alerts, Audience platform engineering Yahoo! Inc December 2007  \u2013  August 2008  (9 months) Overall technical leadership for Yahoo! Alerts V2.0 infrastructure project for around 10 months, till its initial Launch. This was in addition to my responsibilities with the Y! Avatars project. \n \nYahoo! Alerts is a publish-subscribe system, used widely within and outside the company.  \n \nWithin this infrastructure project, I developed the scheduling component and the delayed-alerts component.  \n \nThe scheduling component figures when to send what Alert, and to whom, once a document-match is confirmed,  \nThe delayed-alert component stored the information in case users have subscribed to once-a-day or aggregated feeds, instead of realtime, and triggered a send to the user, at the appropriate time) Lead Software Engineer, Y! Avatars, Audience platform engineering Yahoo! Inc April 2006  \u2013  August 2008  (2 years 5 months) Took over the ownership and technical leadership (Architecture, design, feature development) of Y! Avatars project (backend and frontend). Built, mentored and trained a team of around 10 people including senior engineers, front end engineers, visual and interaction designers, and interfaced with business product managers and content product managers.  \n \nWe built and maintained the software end-to-end, including deployment to and operations of 200+ servers and Multiple Storage Filers, Akamai/CDN, and later transitioned the operations to a dedicated operations team \n \nThe platform handled 300 Million+ views per day, including traffic from big properties like Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo Answers, Yahoo Messenger, and Yahoo Search results page. \n \nWe grew the product from a 3.5Million$$ per year Yahoo! property to 10Million$$ per year property, scaled the platform to handle 50X the traffic it handled when we took over it, Added fault tolerance to the architecture, added redundancy, and released multiple features (including virtual world, and the \"second most used\" Messenger plugin).  \n \nScaling this project within a short duration of 2 months after taking ownership, was critical to the Yahoo! Answers launch, and the then Y! Search EVP Qi Lu was in direct interaction with Senior management of this project, to ensure its success. \n \nThe backend components has challenges related scale and latency. The Server components we developed handled 15k+ requests/second/box, handling data for 60Million+ user-records partitioned and replicated over boxes distributed over many colos, and guaranteeing a 99.5% SLA of < 3 milliseconds.  \n \nThe system allowed users to select and combine \"items\" to create their own display-images (Users could select stuff from amongst a pool of ~7000, and ever/still-growing set of usable items) and this resulted in billions of possible unique combinations/display-images. Trading off storage costs with latency of combining at call-time, was another challenge. Lead Software Engineer, Y! EM Classifieds, Audience platform engineering Yahoo! Inc January 2007  \u2013  September 2007  (9 months) Y! Classifieds version 2.0, launched in Y! Emerging Markets (Y! Singapore, India, Vietnam, Taiwan) \n \nContributed to all areas of the project, and provided technical leadership to the backend team.  \n \nThis project was heavy on MySQL and \"Vespa\" (Vespa is an in-house searchbox solution/vertical search infrastructure, where we had to heavily tweak the parameters contributing to relevancy of documents and ranking of search results across multiple product-categories) Senior Software Engineer, Y! Briefcase 2.0, Audience platform engineering Yahoo! Inc December 2005  \u2013  May 2006  (6 months) Built a fully functional prototype for Y! Briefcase version 2.0 (In approximately 4 months). Was part of a 2 member team which developed this software end-to-end.  \n \nWe also developed a Windows desktop client, exposing features for Yahoo! Briefcase, like automatic backup and restore of data, where you could configure the Folders you want to backup. The restores were check-pointed, and would restart from where it stopped, if you disconnected and reconnected later on.  \n \nThe product was demo'ed to the then Yahoo! COO, Dan Rosensweig, who was evaluating various strategic areas to invest in.  \n(Unfortunately, due to perceived storage costs at that time -- the project didn't get funding :). This was around the time when Gmail had just started ridiculing the whole storage-game. ) \n \n(In this project, we implemented features exposed by the then-famous idrive.com. Recently, companies like mozy.com have exposed similar features) Senior Software Engineer, Y! Message Boards 2.0, Audience platform engineering Yahoo! Inc December 2005  \u2013  April 2006  (5 months) Y!

Also performance tuned the infrastructure (around mysql database backend, and freebsd tcp stack tuning) Senior Software Engineer, Y! Polls 2.0, Audience platform engineering Yahoo! Inc April 2004  \u2013  April 2006  (2 years 1 month) Y! Polls Platform version 2.0, revamping Yahoo's Polls infrastructure to scale to 100Million+ page views per day, and 10M+ writes per day, handling traffic from Y! Finance, Y! sports and Y! News Frontpages (amongst the 35+ Yahoo properties which used this system). This system had a global deployment, with independent setups for multiple geographies (US, Singapore, Latin America, China). The Backend infrastructure was written in C++, with MySQL database backend, and PHP for Templating. One of the first projects at Yahoo! to be built on top of MySQL backend.  \n \nApart from the core backend, I also worked on a unified administration/management tool for this system, through which content producers could create and schedule quizzes/polls for various Yahoo properties, across geographies. (Implementing the admin tool gave me some UI development exposure early on) \n \nWorked mostly as a single man army for the duration of this platform project, architecting, designing, maintaining and deploying, and customer interfacing for 2 years. \n \n \nDuring the duration of this project, I also got an opportunity to train some of Yahoo's Master Oracle DBAs, who were new to the MySQL world ;-) (This was mostly around MySQL configuration for InnoDB engine tweaked for performance, Replication chaining, and selective replication across multiple colos) Software Engineer, Y! Messenger Server Core Yahoo Inc! June 2003  \u2013  March 2004  (10 months) Y! Messenger Server Core. Part of a (then) 10 member team which developed, maintained and deployed all of Y!
