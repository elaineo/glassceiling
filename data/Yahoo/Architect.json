Experience Principal Database/\"Big Data\" Engineer/Architect, User Profile Platform Yahoo 2013  \u2013 Present (2 years) Sunnyvale, CA Building on my expertise in the relational database realm, I am now responsible for defining and annotating schemas to provide structure and both human and programmatic discoverability to large volumes of data from disparate sources centered around the theme of user insights. Using Apache Hive, the User Record Store (URS) which we are developing is charged with ingesting user data (user actions, declared interests, demographic data, etc.) from various sources/teams within Yahoo as well as third party sources. Historically these were in varying hdfs locations, with no consistent or well-documented structure, making it difficult for data to be leveraged across teams and nearly impossible to bring data from different sources together to gain deeper insights. Included in my role is to bring rigor and as much standardization as possible to how we structure the data and evangelize that schema should be treated with the same level of respect as code, as well as to curate metadata with sufficient quality and depth to enable potential consumers to not only find data of interest for their use cases but moreover to unlock previously unobtainable value by joining together data from different sources. Already we have attracted CEO-level visibility with some of our early wins such as inferred gender and integrating Tumblr data into Yahoo interest targeting. \n \nI continue to support all of the team's RDBMS needs as well, including designing and implementing a registry / metadata store for the URS, built on MySQL, and a next-generation User Scoring Database which contains the advertising segment definitions needed by our scoring systems. I have also recently transitioned our database code from subversion to git and am working toward achieving Continuous Integration with our builds. Principal Database Engineer/Architect, Display Ad Targeting Yahoo! 2010  \u2013  2013  (3 years) I led a turnaround effort for a categorization system that is a critical part of Yahoo!'s ad targeting ecosystem, a database which had a vast array of tables, jobs, even entire schemas of unknown history and which no one could say for certain were even used or not, and which served as backend to a UI which in some areas was so non-performant as to be literally unusable, with some screens consistently timing out before they could even be rendered. Through research and reaching out to a wide array of external teams, I was able to shut down or drop many of the extraneous schemas/objects/jobs and my extensive performance tuning efforts led to such a dramatic change in usability of the UI that it was termed as downright \"zippy\". \n \nNext I turned my attention to some highly problematic data architecture issues such as circular replication flows between Targeting's two Oracle databases as well as use of one of them as a pure pass-through recipient of materialized view data which another database queried via dblink. The two databases were consolidated in a phased approach--first physically, then logically--in order to split the risk and disruption given the challenges both technical and organizational. \n \nOver time I further evolved into a data architect role helping fill a void with respect to understanding of end-to-end data flows and even delving into areas such as problem management when I see a gap/exposure. I owned the Targeting piece/impact of several wide-ranging initiatives such as the sunsetting of Yahoo!'s legacy booking system and rearchitecting of APT to leverage data published in object-based rather than pure relational format, and the database portion of our integration with Interclick which includes establishing heterogeneous replication between MSSQL and Oracle. These projects were in addition to continuing to provide ongoing support such as design and code reviews for the database component of all development work by nine scrum teams across three continents. Principal/Lead Database Engineer Yahoo! 2010  \u2013  2012  (2 years) Assumed full ownership of database engineering work for a complex migration project for advertiser accounts which represented a critical success factor of the Y!-Microsoft Search Alliance and which required integrating nearly a dozen systems and similar number of teams in multiple geographies (though RPS results with adCenter have been disappointing, the migration project was regarded as hugely successful). From there, evolved into a lead role with responsibility for a portfolio of several systems including Ad Targeting, Inventory Management, and Opportunity Management/Sales Tools. For each of these properties, I was responsible for ensuring scalability, supportability, adherence to best practices, etc. Specifically this entailed full ownership of all database schema objects and changes managed via a robust build system, as well as performance tuning, consultative/educational efforts on Oracle/RDBMS technology and concepts, and facilitation of communication and translation of requirements between dev/product/qa teams and the operational/infrastructure-oriented DBA team. I also undertook numerous team-level/leadership roles such as defining an \"onboarding\" process for new properties to work with our team, developing a rubric for estimating level of effort for various tasks to aid in developing project plans, and helping establish/maintain an \"architect-track\" working group for mentoring and knowledge-sharing including both delivering tech talks myself and pulling in speakers/experts from outside groups within Y!. Senior/Lead Oracle Database Administrator Yahoo! 2006  \u2013  2009  (3 years) Served as senior/lead DBA on a wide range of Yahoo! Audience and Marketplace properties, most of them high-profile, customer-facing systems. I was responsible for a stabilization effort for Y! Answers, which was deployed with speed-to-market in mind more so than scalability, but which almost overnight became the #2 reference site on the entire WWW behind only Wikipedia, leading to EVP-level visibility of even the smallest database hiccups. My contributions included extensive performance tuning; RAC, Linux, and NetApp architecture work; capacity planning; and many other technical and process changes. I also led a highly successful, from-the-ground-up deployment of two 10-node RAC clusters for a complete rearchitechting of Y! Personals (migrating from MySQL), taking over when the project was three months behind and the customer relationship with the DBA team damaged, and managed to finish over a month ahead of schedule and the customer delighted with the partnership. For each of these (and other) projects, I personally prepared, presented, and defended proposals for needed servers and filers before the Hardware Review Committee, which consists of one of Y!'s co-founders and other VP-level executives, with a 100% success rate. I also aggressively sought out opportunities to save energy and money by reclaiming dozens of unused or under-utilized servers and filers. Moreover I served as interface to Oracle to facilitate tracking and discussions of ongoing technical and support issues, and coordinated weekly executive status reports, redefining roles and responsibilities to streamline what had been a cumbersome process and resulting in higher quality, more complete reports. Database Administrator Hewlett Packard 2004  \u2013  2006  (2 years) Served as lead DBA for one of HP's most sensitive systems, providing single sign-on for many of the company's eCommerce assets, which employed technologies such as Real Application Clusters and Data Guard to meet its exceptional uptime requirements. After joining, I led a highly successful implementation of Oracle's Multi-master Advanced Replication to further enhance system availability. My efforts also enhanced overall robustness of the system through improvements in monitoring, security, etc. \n \nIn addition to primary role as Oracle DBA, I also responded to organizational needs by serving as an MSSQL DBA for Microsoft's Sharepoint knowledge sharing product, as well as Change Manager, with responsibility for tracking, approving, and scheduling all proposed changes to the system as a whole (not just the database component). Senior Database Analyst Waste Management 2002  \u2013  2004  (2 years) As primary DBA for one of the world's largest PeopleSoft HRMS systems, I identified and solved numerous challenges, many involving performance tuning (just one example being a tax-filing extract, late delivery of which would incur a half-million dollar fine, which I tuned from 18 hours to 45 minutes). My contributions were recognized to the point I was elevated to a lead position, and then to acting manager for over half a year while the position was vacant. In this role, I oversaw a team of eight Oracle DBA's, set priorities, communicated regularly with management up to VP-level, etc. Database Administrator The Structure Group 2001  \u2013  2002  (1 year) Serving in a software development environment, in addition to operational DBA tasks, I had the opportunity to gain experience in areas ranging from data modeling (using tools such as Oracle Designer) to the \"packaging\" of releases (developing professional-looking scripts, documentation, etc. to roll out new releases to our client sites). On the latter, management noted that on the first release for which I was responsible for this packaging, we received the best feedback from our customers and fewest support calls of any release to date, despite it being the most technically complex we had yet undertaken. Technology Consultant Accenture 1998  \u2013  2001  (3 years) My roles with Accenture ranged from hands-on DBA and other technical work, to technology strategy (e.g., evaluating products and asking the tough questions of vendors to design the overall technology and application footprint for a startup company), to project management/resource planning. I assumed my first team lead role after less than a year of total IT experience and was promoted from analyst/staff to consultant/senior in the shortest allowable timeframe. Gained invaluable experience and perspective from exposure to a wide variety of projects and industries and Accenture software lifecycle methodologies. Over the latter part of my tenure I specialized in Retek (now Oracle Retail) software and worked with several retail clients, including an instrumental role in implementing perpetual inventory for the first time at one of America's most admired and respected companies. Intern, Advanced Technologies Group Hoechst Celanese May 1995  \u2013  August 1995  (4 months) Principal Database/\"Big Data\" Engineer/Architect, User Profile Platform Yahoo 2013  \u2013 Present (2 years) Sunnyvale, CA Building on my expertise in the relational database realm, I am now responsible for defining and annotating schemas to provide structure and both human and programmatic discoverability to large volumes of data from disparate sources centered around the theme of user insights. Using Apache Hive, the User Record Store (URS) which we are developing is charged with ingesting user data (user actions, declared interests, demographic data, etc.) from various sources/teams within Yahoo as well as third party sources. Historically these were in varying hdfs locations, with no consistent or well-documented structure, making it difficult for data to be leveraged across teams and nearly impossible to bring data from different sources together to gain deeper insights. Included in my role is to bring rigor and as much standardization as possible to how we structure the data and evangelize that schema should be treated with the same level of respect as code, as well as to curate metadata with sufficient quality and depth to enable potential consumers to not only find data of interest for their use cases but moreover to unlock previously unobtainable value by joining together data from different sources. Already we have attracted CEO-level visibility with some of our early wins such as inferred gender and integrating Tumblr data into Yahoo interest targeting. \n \nI continue to support all of the team's RDBMS needs as well, including designing and implementing a registry / metadata store for the URS, built on MySQL, and a next-generation User Scoring Database which contains the advertising segment definitions needed by our scoring systems. I have also recently transitioned our database code from subversion to git and am working toward achieving Continuous Integration with our builds.
