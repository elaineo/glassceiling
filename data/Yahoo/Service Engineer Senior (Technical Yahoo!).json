This was in addition to my responsibilities with the Y! Avatars project. \n \nYahoo! Alerts is a publish-subscribe system, used widely within and outside the company.  \n \nWithin this infrastructure project, I developed the scheduling component and the delayed-alerts component.  \n \nThe scheduling component figures when to send what Alert, and to whom, once a document-match is confirmed,  \nThe delayed-alert component stored the information in case users have subscribed to once-a-day or aggregated feeds, instead of realtime, and triggered a send to the user, at the appropriate time) Lead Software Engineer, Y!

Mail, Yahoo Answers, Yahoo Messenger, and Yahoo Search results page. \n \nWe grew the product from a 3.5Million$$ per year Yahoo! property to 10Million$$ per year property, scaled the platform to handle 50X the traffic it handled when we took over it, Added fault tolerance to the architecture, added redundancy, and released multiple features (including virtual world, and the \"second most used\" Messenger plugin).  \n \nScaling this project within a short duration of 2 months after taking ownership, was critical to the Yahoo! Answers launch, and the then Y! Search EVP Qi Lu was in direct interaction with Senior management of this project, to ensure its success. \n \nThe backend components has challenges related scale and latency. The Server components we developed handled 15k+ requests/second/box, handling data for 60Million+ user-records partitioned and replicated over boxes distributed over many colos, and guaranteeing a 99.5% SLA of < 3 milliseconds.  \n \nThe system allowed users to select and combine \"items\" to create their own display-images (Users could select stuff from amongst a pool of ~7000, and ever/still-growing set of usable items) and this resulted in billions of possible unique combinations/display-images.
