Experience Senior Software Engineer REVENUE.com 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year) Revenue.com is a premier native advertising platform that provides beautiful, easily customizable, in-stream advertising for content publishers, while helping advertisers and publishers to maximize monetization. \n \nWith increased growth, the product needed to scale up its ability to handle drastic increases in number of daily ad impressions. I did a complete migration of years of legacy data to a new architecture on AWS, and built new high performance systems for tracking high traffic loads of ad impressions and processing financial transactions for those impressions. In the end, I scaled the system to about 100x performance, allowing for about 200 million ad impressions per day.
