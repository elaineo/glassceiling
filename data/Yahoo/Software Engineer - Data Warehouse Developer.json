Centricity DMS is an information system designed to support the clinical and administrative activities associated with Cardiovascular Departments. Centricity DMS facilitates the administrative and clinical workflow such as order entry, results entry, device interfacing, results reporting and patient record retrieval. Centricity DMS is intended to store and provide access to patient\u2019s complete cardiovascular electronic medical record, integrating information and data from cardiovascular departments. It is used in the cardiovascular departments, including EKG, Stress, Echo, Nuclear, Cath, EP and Cardiac Surgery. DMS integrates with other Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and devices through standard HL7 Interfaces and DICOM standards. DMS utilizes an Oracle 10g database. Senior Software Engineer/Data Warehouse Architect LodgeNet Interactive, Corporation August 2008  \u2013  July 2011  (3 years) Sioux Falls, South Dakota Area I was assigned to LGARS (LodgeNet Guest Activity Reporting System) which is a 4 Terabyte Oracle data warehouse for tracking guest activity which contains several tables containing more than 1 billion records as well as one table over 5 billion. LGARS provides reporting information to Marketing, Advertising, Logistics, Engineering, Sales and others. The data warehouse was utilized for reporting occupancy; guest activity; advertiser\u2019s proof of viewership; contracts; service level agreements; sales; customer call tickets etc. to internal as well as external customers including IMN, SEC, and MPAA. \n \nI developed standards for LGARS including column naming, data types and PL/SQL coding. I created an ETL jobs module used to track and control ETL processing including automatic tracking of ETL PL/SQL CVS information within the database. I implemented ETL performance enhancements by using partition exchange and DML error logging and correctly setting Oracle database and UNIX system parameters. I reduced overall system disk utilization by identifying unused records, moving data improperly located in facts to dimensions, and implementing database compression. I identified one database setting and one system setting that significantly hindered ETL processes and reporting allowing one critical monthly report that had never successfully ran to completion to complete in 8 minutes. The updated setting resolved numerous other reporting performance issues. I also improved report performance via correct implementation of a star schema and the star transformation join.
