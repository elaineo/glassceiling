The feature served as a pilot for Node.js use by Contacts as well as a nice enhancement to the product in and of itself; its success is prompting more Node.js development by the team. \n \nIn order to meet some new product requirements for mail search, I created a search autocomplete component for Yahoo mail's front end which federates multiple types of data across a variety of services which return their data asynchronously. The component is very flexible, supporting the ability to hook up data sources, renderers, and selection handlers from any number of data providers, all of whom can return their data at any time. Replaced the current, inflexible, hodge-podge solutions in mail supporting some subsets of this functionality, and refactored accordingly.  \n \nUsing Node.js/Express, I built a tool used by one of the editorial teams in Yahoo. The tool required reading from and writing to large files, so for performance reasons, it used Node's streaming APIs. \n \nCreated a web client (using jQuery) to help test, develop, and prove out a new search related project at Yahoo. The client was developed while working in tandem with engineers owning the server component to help prove out the model of what was needed for the project and to learn how best to structure the project's APIs. The client supports streaming responses via chunked transfer encoding. Software Engineer Xobni November 2009  \u2013  July 2013  (3 years 9 months) Worked on Xobni\u2019s generic out of box/on-boarding application. It's a flexible, rich web client backed by Node.js. It is used by several web and native mobile clients to walk users through our login, signup, and third-party OAuth flows. \n \nI was one of the lead developers for a Chrome/Firefox/Safari extension that integrates Xobni functionality with GMail (https://www.xobni.com/download/gmail). This is a single-page HTML5/Javascript application that uses Xobni's cloud API to fetch rich contact data to display as the user interacts with email messages in GMail. \n \nBuilt a CardDAV server for Xobni contacts in Node.js (on top of jsDAV). This allows the iPhone and OSX Address Book, for example, to sync locally a user's Xobni contacts without a special Xobni client. This is an ongoing pet project. \n \nBuilt an LDAP adapter for Xobni contacts in Node.js (on top of ldapjs). This allows the iPhone and other LDAP clients to perform LDAP directory searches against a user's Xobni contacts.  \n \nVarious nodejs/Express services to showcase Xobni's data. \n \nC#/.NET programming for the world's leading Outlook plugin, focusing particularly on the .NET/COM bridge, Win32 API hooks (e.g. subclassing Windows messages), and COM Addin support.

Software Engineer Gaia Online March 2008  \u2013  November 2009  (1 year 9 months) Senior Flex 3/ActionScript 3.0 developer for zOMG! \n \nI added many game features, but was particularly focused on optimization and efficiency issues (e.g. finding and fixing reasons for low frame rates and excessive garbage collection). \n \nI helped spearhead the project to retroactively add Flex to the game, and architected a new UI framework based on Flex modules. I also implemented several new and improved UI elements. \n \nI wrote the MMO's wrapper around AOL\u2019s ActionScript AIM API (wimas3), implementing chat over AIM for the game. \n \nGaia had no build process for its front-end applications when I joined, so I created a continuous integration system, back-porting several projects to use it, including zOMG! Senior Software Engineer Yahoo! June 2006  \u2013  March 2008  (1 year 10 months) Senior developer for a Flex 3/ActionScript 3.0 implementation of Y! Messenger for the Web \n \nI was one of the key architects and implementers of Yahoo!\u2019s web messenger product, built using ActionScript 3.0 and the Flex 3 framework. I also designed and built a continuous build system for the project. This product was spun off into JetBlue\u2019s instant messenger solution on its planes in flight. \n \nThe product was also spun off into myM, a web messenger product that integrated messages, wall posts, vitality information, etc. from Facebook, MySpace, and AIM. myM was released in beta internally and to some test groups with much acclaim, but Yahoo! shelved the product in early 2007 before releasing it to the general public. Staff Software Engineer Intuit February 2005  \u2013  June 2006  (1 year 5 months) Served as technical lead for a team of five regular (and sometimes as many as ten) developers refactoring the QuickBooks code base to remove the limits on the number of elements in a QuickBooks list (these are feature-level lists, such as the Customer List, Vendor List, Item List, etc.). Essentially, this involved changing a fundamental data type used in a very large codebase. Because the list subsystem and this data type permeated the codebase, the project had tremendous impact on the product and required changes to almost every major piece of functionality in QuickBooks (approximately 200,000 lines of code were changed across more than 20 modules); it also posed particular problems for serialization code and external (e.g. API) clients. The challenges in the project included rooting out what portions of the codebase (often old and undocumented) would be affected, figuring out how to change them, and helping to manage and coordinate a very large set of changes. \n \nCritical to the success of the project was my development of an instrumentation class to cause compilation errors in many places where we missed changing one of these fundamental data types. Lead Software Engineer FactSet Research Systems January 2004  \u2013  January 2005  (1 year 1 month) Lead architect and programmer for many solutions that integrated FactSet\u2019s data with Microsoft Office (Active Publishing Workstation (APW) and the FactSet-Excel Link), using C++, COM, ActiveX, Win32, DDE, Excel's binary file format, and VBA. \n \nAPW was FactSet\u2019s publishing solution, allowing users to populate and update Office documents with FactSet financial data; the FactSet-Excel Link allowed clients to integrate FactSet data into their spreadsheets in a myriad of ways, including the exporting server-based reports to Excel (using XML and HTML), providing custom worksheet functions to retrieve FactSet data, real-time updates in Excel cells (using DDE), and merging requested FactSet data into Excel files on disk by manipulating the Excel file format (BIFF). \n \nHelped spearhead FactSet\u2019s transition from multibyte to Unicode in its PC applications. Wrote the code to enable all the Office integration products and features to support Unicode. Senior Software Engineer, Lead Excel developer FactSet Research Systems October 2001  \u2013  January 2004  (2 years 4 months) Rearchitected FactSet's Excel spreadsheet updating functionality (called Data Downloading), replacing a difficult to maintain and to enhance algorithm involving file format manipulation with an algorithm based on OLE automation of Excel and HTML/XML/CSS. This enabled several important enhancements that were outstanding requests for many years. The process involved touching a great deal of low-level code and modifying FactSet's proprietary protocols for transmitting data. \n \nRearchitected FactSet's mechanism for exporting online reports to Excel, replacing a DDE-based mechanism with an XML/HTML/clipboard based one. Based on my architecture and leadership, FactSet is now able to export reports to PowerPoint presentations and to Word documents. \n \nImplemented linking of Excel cells populated with FactSet data to online documents from which the data was pulled, architecting a solution that uses a custom URL protocol and COM. Software Engineer FactSet Software Systems October 1998  \u2013  October 2001  (3 years 1 month) Taught myself C++, COM, MFC, and the Windows API after not having programmed in C for 10 years. \n \nVarious enhancements to FactSet's home-grown thin client, using C++, MFC, and the Windows API. \n \nRearchitected FactSet's custom worksheet function for retrieving user-requested data. Converted the code from an old Excel C API to using Excel OLE automation, fixed many bugs, and implemented many enhancements and stabilizations. Instructor, Teaching Assistant Johns Hopkins University, Center for Talented Youth January 1985  \u2013  January 1997  (12 years 1 month) Instructor and co-author of a text for Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science at Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth (CTY) summer program. Johns Hopkins\u2019 CTY program allows academically gifted junior high school and high school students to study college and graduate level material over the summer. In a single three week session, they learned in my course Pascal or Scheme; Propositional Logic; finite state automata theory; the Chomsky hierarchy; and Turing Machines and undecidability. Since no course like this exists elsewhere, a co-author and I devised a 200+ page textbook to serve as the course text. Senior Software Engineer Yahoo!
