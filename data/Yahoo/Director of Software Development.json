Senior Software Engineer IBM Almaden Research Center July 1997  \u2013  April 2004  (6 years 10 months) I worked at the IBM Almaden Rearch Center for many years as a senior software engineer, where I conducted research in the area of web information retrieval and search techologies. I was a key contributor and engineer of IBM's OmniFind enterprise search product, where I devised and implemented several algorithms to improve its overall ranking and search quality. My strong engineering and system building skills contributed significantly to the success of this product. In addition, I worked on several other search related projects at IBM. One of them has been recoginized a research accomplishment in 2002.
