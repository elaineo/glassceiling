The deeply relevant, highly contextual copy that people encounter during their online experience, the copy that blends almost invisibly into the background of an effortless user experience, is provided by copywriters like me.  \n \nAs a UX copywriter my work often falls within the minutia of creating the user experience, but I do so with the benefit of a big picture view, often informed by being included in the concepting, ideation and decision making of multiple teams and projects.  \n \nDuring my time as a copywriter I have worked primarily with medium to large companies, developing interactive content, including both user interface and marketing copy.  \n \nMy goal is always to make that content easy to read, easy to understand and appropriate for the audience, brand, and communication channel.  \n \nI work well independently, but more often I work collaboratively with a creative team. I have been fortunate to work closely with, and learn from, other skilled professionals. This not only includes other writers and editors, but many designers, information architects and developers, as well as project managers, marketers, attorneys, and management at all levels. \n \nSpecialties: User experience, interactive content, content strategy, marketing and communications. \n \nGallup StrengthsFinder Top 5: Intellection | Strategic | Learner | Adaptability | Connectedness Experience Sr. Copywriter - User Experience Best Buy April 2011  \u2013 Present (4 years 5 months) Richfield, Minnesota As a member of the BestBuy.com User Experience team my focus is on content and the overall customer experience.
