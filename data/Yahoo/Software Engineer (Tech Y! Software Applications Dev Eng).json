Tech Y! Software Engineer Yahoo! January 2012  \u2013  August 2014  (2 years 8 months) Santa Clara, CA Software Development Engineer in Display Ad and Targeting system. I worked on serving component Ad Centric Targeting System (ACTS) for more than 2 years.  \n \nACTS (Audience Centric Targeting Service) objective is to display ads relevant to Yahoo's financial objectives and the needs of the user as reflected in the properties accessed for a given a specific user and property. The pipeline on the consumer side starts with Yahoo property making call to the Federated Ad Component (FAC). FAC makes a call to Ad Server (MME(retired), NGD(RMX), DSP(admovate), GD(retired) or GD2(APT)) by targeting geo, demo or behavioral. The Ad Server calls UPS with Cookie, IP, UPS Attributes and Context Ids information. And UPS executes the ACT module returning the segments, recency and frequency information. \n \nAs a developer I worked on projects specific to Ad Targeting and placement in Yahoo display systems.  \n \n- Techno Targeting v1 and v2 \n- Geo Targeting  \n- Demo Targeting  \n- Behavioral Targeting \n- Search/Mail Targeting/Re-Targeting \n \nI developed features as well as helped the team built/code a strong automation framework in TestNg. \n \nRecent projects/ features on the component include B-cookie age targeting (targeting user on cookie ages).  \n \nDuring the 2 year tenure I also worked on UPUSH component. I implemented ADX population reports on u-push. Came up with detailed design and identified dependencies, and had suggestions/options to mitigate them. Graduate Student University of California, Irvine September 2010  \u2013  December 2011  (1 year 4 months) Graduate Student at the Department of Computer Science, pursing my Masters in Computer Science (Networks). \n \nProjects \n \nCloud Based Framework for Rich Mobile Application \n-- The main aim of project was to implement a cyber foraging system (mobile offloading), where we setup a client-server model with mobile cloud (Windows Azure, Amazon EC2) acting as the server while our mobile devices (laptop, Android phone) acting as client. \n-- In this two quarter project, we first used two open sources projects \u201cJava OCR\u201d and Java based \u201cZxing barcode reader\u201d to test and measure various performance parameters such as power consumption (cpu, wifi) on the mobile device using a local server vs the cloud (windows azure). \n-- As a continuation in the second quarter, we setup a video streaming from cloud (Amazon EC2 and local server) to mobile devices via a buffering server and tested and measured different performance parameters. We also developed an augmented reality application on android which used cloud services (Amazon EC2) for major computation. \n-- Major part of the application was developed in Java and android. Some part of augmented reality was written in C++. \n \nArduino based music visualizer \n-- The main aim of this project was to use Arduino processor to simultaneously play a audio file as well as display a visualization of the file. Similar to the work found in visualization plugins such as iTunes, Winamp, Windows media player, etc. \n-- Our project was an amalgamation of three chips namely, Arduino processor, Adafruit wave shield and 4D Display shield. We basically read a audio file from SD card of the wave shield, buffered, played it on the wave shield and simultaneously ran a FFT algorithm over it and displayed the output on the display shield. \n-- Libraries for wave shield and display shield were written in C, where as Arduino processor used its own assembly language to run applications. Software Engineer Intern Yahoo! June 2011  \u2013  September 2011  (4 months) Santa Clara, CA Cookie database \n-- Wrote data scripts which injects cookies into database to be used by Targeting Test Framework for integration testing. \n-- Implemented Cookie factory -with the usage of hibernate and spring framework- which provides API's to use the cookies from the database based on special queries made by user. \n-- This is on-going internship and current work includes to design the datahighway event to support a wide variety of events such as pageviews, ad-clicks, ad-views, search link clicks, paid search link clicks, partner searches, and automate user activity event generation to test real time targeting system. Software engineer R&D Nokia Siemens Networks July 2008  \u2013  July 2010  (2 years 1 month) Two years of extensive experience in design, development and testing in VoIP (SIP & IMS) domain. Projects worked on are :- \n \nCFX-based Access SBC for NVS \n-- The aim of the project is to replace Acme packet SBC with Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) SBC, the CFX 5000. Features supported were call handling for users behind NAT, privacy support, topology hiding and proxy authorization. \n-- Responsibilities undertaken were to maintain the SIP call control module, realize Privacy support and topology hiding as \ndescribed in RFC 3323 and program Digest authentication and IMS AKA authentication support. \n-- Maintained all the reported modification requests for the above described features and executed unit test cases for the above. \n \nMobile Device Keep Alive \n-- The aim of the project is to ensure that IMS users behind Radio Access Networks are not put to dormant state. When IMS user is in a dormant state, there are no procedures currently supported at the P-CSCF to know if the IMS user is alive. \n-- Implemented functionality for Parsing of the SDP content to detect session status, realizing the Offer Answer Controller as \ndefined in RFC 3264, implementing APIs for starting/stopping timer was necessary. \n-- Executed the unit test cases for the above features and maintained all the reported modification requests for the above described features. \n \nComponent owner of P-CSCF and IBCF \n-- PCSCF is a SIP proxy that is the first point of contact to IMS and forms the core component of CSCF. IBCF is used as gateway to external networks, and provides NAT and Firewall functions. \n-- Running regression (test cases) successfully and maintaining the code stability always and specifically during process crashes. Updating documents on a regular basis.

Tech Y! Software Engineer Yahoo! January 2012  \u2013  August 2014  (2 years 8 months) Santa Clara, CA Software Development Engineer in Display Ad and Targeting system. I worked on serving component Ad Centric Targeting System (ACTS) for more than 2 years.  \n \nACTS (Audience Centric Targeting Service) objective is to display ads relevant to Yahoo's financial objectives and the needs of the user as reflected in the properties accessed for a given a specific user and property. The pipeline on the consumer side starts with Yahoo property making call to the Federated Ad Component (FAC). FAC makes a call to Ad Server (MME(retired), NGD(RMX), DSP(admovate), GD(retired) or GD2(APT)) by targeting geo, demo or behavioral. The Ad Server calls UPS with Cookie, IP, UPS Attributes and Context Ids information. And UPS executes the ACT module returning the segments, recency and frequency information. \n \nAs a developer I worked on projects specific to Ad Targeting and placement in Yahoo display systems.  \n \n- Techno Targeting v1 and v2 \n- Geo Targeting  \n- Demo Targeting  \n- Behavioral Targeting \n- Search/Mail Targeting/Re-Targeting \n \nI developed features as well as helped the team built/code a strong automation framework in TestNg. \n \nRecent projects/ features on the component include B-cookie age targeting (targeting user on cookie ages).  \n \nDuring the 2 year tenure I also worked on UPUSH component. I implemented ADX population reports on u-push. Came up with detailed design and identified dependencies, and had suggestions/options to mitigate them. Tech Y! Software Engineer Yahoo!

Graduate Student University of California, Irvine September 2010  \u2013  December 2011  (1 year 4 months) Graduate Student at the Department of Computer Science, pursing my Masters in Computer Science (Networks). \n \nProjects \n \nCloud Based Framework for Rich Mobile Application \n-- The main aim of project was to implement a cyber foraging system (mobile offloading), where we setup a client-server model with mobile cloud (Windows Azure, Amazon EC2) acting as the server while our mobile devices (laptop, Android phone) acting as client. \n-- In this two quarter project, we first used two open sources projects \u201cJava OCR\u201d and Java based \u201cZxing barcode reader\u201d to test and measure various performance parameters such as power consumption (cpu, wifi) on the mobile device using a local server vs the cloud (windows azure). \n-- As a continuation in the second quarter, we setup a video streaming from cloud (Amazon EC2 and local server) to mobile devices via a buffering server and tested and measured different performance parameters. We also developed an augmented reality application on android which used cloud services (Amazon EC2) for major computation. \n-- Major part of the application was developed in Java and android. Some part of augmented reality was written in C++. \n \nArduino based music visualizer \n-- The main aim of this project was to use Arduino processor to simultaneously play a audio file as well as display a visualization of the file. Similar to the work found in visualization plugins such as iTunes, Winamp, Windows media player, etc. \n-- Our project was an amalgamation of three chips namely, Arduino processor, Adafruit wave shield and 4D Display shield. We basically read a audio file from SD card of the wave shield, buffered, played it on the wave shield and simultaneously ran a FFT algorithm over it and displayed the output on the display shield. \n-- Libraries for wave shield and display shield were written in C, where as Arduino processor used its own assembly language to run applications.

This allowed for faster and easier deployments by including these packages in in the local kickstart/jumpstart environments along with our custom deployment platform. \n \n* Technical Architect for homegrown software management and deployment platform. This platform allows users from development, QA and operations to build, test and deploy code and applications to their respective environments. This cut deployment time and testing from days and months to minutes and hours. \n \n* Technical Architect for the migration from old VMware server and physical server infrastructure to VMware ESXi. This allows for better use of infrastructure resources while also providing better redundancy in the event of any hardware failures. This dramatically reduces the support and environmental costs from the current large installation footprint. \n \n* Built a VMware ESXi addon module for the homegrown software management and deployment platform that uses the VMware Java SDK to pull data from ESXi and vCenter. The integration includes being able to power on, power off, reset and provision new virtual machines within the management platform. This gives users quicker access to the virtual machine controls as well as removes the necessity of the user to console to the specific VMware ESXi server to perform these tasks. \n \n* Spearheaded an initiative to architect and move many production servers into Amazon\u2019s virtual private cloud. Using Amazon\u2019s API\u2019s I was able to integrate the automated provisioning and fully utilize the elasticity of the cloud for the business.

The plan covered all aspects for the US operations and projects including technical, financial and people. \n \n* Responsible for maintenance and support of all configurations and modifications to the central Translink system & software (Change Management).  \n \n* Developed and implemented a jumpstart server strategy at regional collocation facilities and local offices. This included developing custom profiles, drivers and post installation scripts for both sparc and x86 platforms. The implementation was key to the constant deployment of the seven test beds that were used to meet the aggressive dates for several US projects.
