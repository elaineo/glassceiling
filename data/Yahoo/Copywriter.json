Hence, I've simultaneously held a wide variety of jobs and exercise many skills and talents. My first priority is to continue a career in baseball in one capacity or another. My trauma nursing background allows me to act as a trainer, my degree in statistics helps in compiling coaching stats and scoring games, my physical condition allows me to accept positions as a Strength & Conditioning Coach, my certification as a Medical & Vocational Rehabilitation Specialist aids in my treatment of injuries, I'm experienced in rehabilitating pitcher and player arms while working with one of the most esteemed specialists in the US and I can mow a field, put down lines, fix a mound and run a pro-style workout. I can also bench coach. \n \nIn addition, I've been a writer who has sought interesting and challenging assignments for over 25 years. I am experienced in \"soft blogging,\" regular contributions to customers' blogs, writing/rewriting retail catalogues, writing/rewriting online websites, ghostwriting, sports pieces (primarily baseball), health articles, medical articles, drug/medication pieces, fitness instruction, cooking and nutrition articles, technology, travel and e-books. I continue to seek more writing gigs with individuals or companies seeking more than a robotic regurgitation of information and keywords, that pay enough so that I don't qualify for poverty programs and with enough work so that most of my time is not spent seeking work, but DOING it. \n \nMy former online portfolio is no longer functional and a great deal of work is lost as many of the sites I wrote for have been updated.
