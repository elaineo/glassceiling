In this role, I perform data mining, data scrubbing, data manipulation, and visualization on a regular basis. Sometimes I apply a little flavor of statistics concept, like histogram, time-series, and simply distribution fitting. \n \nUsing data to learn about process performance and recommend improvements emphasizes the need to produce the metrics and reports routinely. Such task can be tedious. But thankfully with my Mechatronics background, programming is rarely a problem for me. I have the passion in me to automate every task that is repetitive.
