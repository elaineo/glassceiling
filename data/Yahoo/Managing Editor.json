Homes property \u2014 a content-to-commerce site formerly known as Yahoo! Real Estate \u2014 with many millions of pageviews a month. My duties include daily and big-picture tasks:  \n \n+ Content strategy \n+ Simultaneous work on the existing \"footprint\" site as well as a groundbreaking proposed site \n+ Collaborating on the visual design and taxonomy of the proposed site \n+ Partner management as well as freelancer management (more than two dozen companies and individuals, including Forbes, CNBC, Hearst and Conde Nast publications) \n+ Lead generation \n+ Selecting, writing, editing and producing multiple stories and slideshows a day for Yahoo!\u2019s blockbuster front page, Yahoo.com \n+ Programming Yahoo!

Homes Pinterest account, which was at 60 when I came aboard, is up more than 6,000%. \n+ I\u2019m measuring labor vs. payoff in circulating traffic across the Homes site and the Yahoo! network via in-line links. Results so far: an average of roughly a million \u201cbonus\u201d page views each week that we wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had. \n+ In Q1 2013, Yahoo! Homes\u2019 group pool on Flickr doubled. Our quarterly goal had been a 50% increase. Outreach manager, Yahoo! Contributor Network Yahoo! 2011  \u2013  July 2012  (1 year) My mandate was to find high-value writers and elevate the editorial quality of Yahoo! Contributor Network, Yahoo!\u2019s platform and 500,000-member community for expert freelancers and user-generated content (UGC). The position, which was invented for me, straddled editorial and community functions \u2014 and I also expanded it into product solutions when appropriate:  \n \n+ I recruited and cultivated dozens of notable writers including renowned travel expert Rick Steves for a $1.5 million sales project; a Hollywood screenwriter for Yahoo! Movies; a former Iowa House speaker for Yahoo! News\u2019 caucus coverage; and two sportswriters who alone have brought millions of pageviews to Yahoo! Sports. \n+ I managed and wrote all external marketing campaigns, including banner ads, social media ads (e.g., LinkedIn and Facebook), search engine marketing (SEM), and partnerships with job sites. \n+ Through marketing, copywriting, and internal and external evangelizing, I helped rebrand YCN as Yahoo!\u2019s entrepreneurial platform for bloggers, industry experts and thought leaders. Publishing volume from YCN to Yahoo!\u2019s marquee sites at least doubled after my hire, as the quality of YCN content rose.  \n+ I developed what was called \u201cthe most inspired editorial idea to come out of YCN\u201d all year, a custom solution to elicit eloquent expert content from nonwriters on a mass scale. I also successfully proposed a targeting tool to filter the best assignments for the best writers. \n+ For Yahoo! sales teams, I established internal \u201cportfolio\u201d websites to showcase writers who could be cited in pitches and activated for sponsored campaigns such as branded microsites. \n+ I managed YCN\u2019s presence at events including the annual conferences of BlogHer, BlogWorld, and the Online News Association (ONA).  \n+ I collected, analyzed and reported data on user acquisition and activation (recruits per path of entry, conversion rate to published contributor, etc.). Editor, Yahoo! News Yahoo! January 2010  \u2013  April 2011  (1 year 4 months) I was hired to support what became the second-biggest media launch of 2010 (according to the New York Observer). As copy editor for the blog network founded by Andrew Golis (formerly of Talking Points Media), I ensured items\u2019 clarity and accuracy. Yahoo! News Network was No. 1 in its category, its audience about double that of runner-up CNN Network. Key achievements: \n \n+ Editors for Yahoo!\u2019s blockbuster front page (hundreds of millions of unique users a month) requested me by name to mold and sometimes rewrite blog items destined for the Today module.  \n+ On my own initiative, I analyzed headlines and click-through rates (CTR) and conducted informal A/B bucket testing to determine optimal wording.  \n+ I promoted circulation throughout the Yahoo! network and quantifiably drove hundreds of thousands of page views by adding engagement links to stories, again on my own initiative during \u201cdowntime.\u201d I measured that traffic with bit.ly links \u2014 which, anecdotally, seems to have been Yahoo!\u2019s first use of bit.ly. After I taught co-workers about bit.ly, its use spread throughout Yahoo!. \n+ I earned a $3,000 \u201cspot\u201d bonus for my work as a Yahoo! News lead on the integration of Yahoo!\u2019s $100 million acquisition Associated Content (now Yahoo! Contributor Network). I helped innovate the solicitation and use of first-person news accounts via Associated Content/YCN on Yahoo! News, and I wrote stories aggregating those reports. Editor, National Copy Desk Los Angeles Times 2004  \u2013  2009  (5 years) I worked on the prestigious national desk, eventually taking on daily duties vetting colleagues\u2019 editing, headlines, captions, etc. When I left, I was vetting the front page itself \u2014 the highest-profile duty a copy editor can do. The job also involved deep editing of long features and breaking news on tight deadline. I won national awards for headline writing; I helped initiate the paper\u2019s main Twitter account, @LATimes; and I was one of the first copy editors to work on the paper\u2019s blogs. Front-page news editor St. Paul Pioneer Press 1995  \u2013  2004  (9 years) I oversaw the front page of the newspaper in Minnesota's capital city. Editor of Yahoo! Homes Yahoo!
