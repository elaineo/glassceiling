My career has always surrounded itself around being an IT Professional in many different facets of business. I have prided myself in deep diving into the many different tasks and projects (big or small) as both a learning and career accelerating experience. With that said in the last 10 years my path has been pulled into a more hands on technical role but my experience in IT Management has solidified my abilities to lead and take ownership of the work I am responsible for. I take pride in being highly motivated in problem solving, applying effort with quality results, offering a steady stream of communication with my colleagues and counterparts.  \n \nPersonality dictates everything in life so does it in business., One of my primary focuses has been absorbing as much as I can and investigating on my own initiative all about your typical non-typical business goals and requirements by being engaged and adding positive energy.
