Sight can be as limiting as the field of view. Sound adds to what sight can't grasp - a bull charging from behind, a rattlesnake on the right or even a whisper moving from the left ear behind the head to the right ear.  \n \nWith Dolby Atmos for Virtual Reality technology and tools, we aim to help content creators create object-based sound on a 3 dimensional space and encode their creation such that they are decoded and rendered binaurally (headphones) with precision and efficiency when an end user listens to the content. The artistic intent and creative integrity is maintained and preserve from the content creation to consumption by an end user thereby ensuring a full immersion into the virtual world. \n Senior Product Manager, Mobile Shopping and Emerging Platforms Amazon April 2015  \u2013  June 2015  (3 months) San Francisco New features on mobile shopping applications and other new initiatives.
