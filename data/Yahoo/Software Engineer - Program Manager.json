I've created content management systems, click-through-rate (CTR) stats reports, automated feed processing scripts using PHP, MySQL, Perl and Apache. I have been coming up to speed on professional frontend development using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to make desktop-like applications. I'd like to do more. \n \nIn contrast to prototypical engineers who primarily hone their \"hard\" technical skills, I like to use and develop my \"soft\" skills as well. I communicate effectively with feature-crazed product managers, stressed-out project managers, detail-oriented QA teams, and relevancy-seeking editors. I seek to understand what they want so that I can give them what they need with the goal of delighting them in the process. Oh, and I love to write thorough twiki pages, it's the only way to write living docs.  \n \nAnd finally, I'd like to say that I love to work at Internet companies.
