Experience VP, Video Product Yahoo January 2013  \u2013 Present (2 years 8 months) Sunnyvale, ca I lead the product team for video in Yahoo's media group. My focus is on the consumer experience for watching video. That includes playback quality, our video destination, our video player and how the player is integrated across yahoo sites across devices. Vice President / Snr Director Product Management - Yahoo Media Yahoo! Inc. April 2009  \u2013  January 2013  (3 years 10 months) Sunnyvale, CA This is really two roles combined into one description. In one role I was the product lead for Yahoo News which was one of the world's biggest news sites in something like 25 countries.  \n \nIn the other role I was taking the building blocks of Yahoo News - article pages, photo galleries, videos and lists - and bottling up that product for other Yahoo sites to use as well so that they didn't have to reinvent the wheel.  \n \nSo in these roles I spent a lot of time thinking and testing and pouring over data about how users consume content, I learned what it takes to build and ship a product across devices and I learned what it takes to build, ship and manage a product globally. I also helped move our dev teams from shipping pretty infrequently to at least once a week, globally, across devices, across many experiences. Amazing learning experience. \n \nFor those who care about this kind of thing, I was promoted to VP around March 2012. So I was a senior director for part of the time in this role. Director, Product Management Yahoo! HotJobs March 2005  \u2013  March 2009  (4 years 1 month) Sunnyvale, CA I was responsible for product management of the consumer facing side of Yahoo! Hotjobs. #1 accomplishment in this position was the introduction of a job recommendation engine which we grew to drive about 25% of job applications. Best thing about this role was sitting with an awesome engineering team and cranking out product after product that made metrics better. Hardest thing about the role was trying to make great consumer focused changes to a product that had a giant revenue line! Intern, Yahoo! Messenger Yahoo! June 2003  \u2013  August 2003  (3 months) Sunnyvale, CA I did my b-school internship at Yahoo. I worked on Yahoo Messenger, specifically in the BU working on \"Business Messenger\" which was trying to deliver Y!M to enterprises. Solution in search of a problem. Director, Finance Agillion Inc. 1999  \u2013  2001  (2 years) Agillion was a startup in Austin. Our product let SMBs share information with their customers via personalized web pages that could be created with a few clicks, featuring collaboration tools like message boards and groups. It was all web-based and priced via subscription so affordable. \n \nI started in a finance role. Basically, I ran \u201cthe model\u201d which tracked where all of the money we raised was getting spent. It was a big job, because we spent a lot of money. Unfortunately we didn't really make any.  \n \nI was pretty heavily involved in our very valiant effort to raise a $20M-ish Series C round. Helped make the pitches. Ran the due diligence process. Didn't work though. I stayed on after company downsized to help the CEO raise a $2M round for a new company. That round actually worked, although I left right before it closed. I took some time off, and then went to business school. \n \nThe company was a famous failure in Austin but I had the great opportunity to work with some great thinkers and learn a massive amount about what it takes to run a 100-ish person business. It was here that I also started to make the leap into product management, out of my pure numbers role. Senior Auditor Ernst & Young LLP August 1995  \u2013  March 1999  (3 years 8 months) My first job after college. Did 30 to 40 audits, mostly young tech companies in Austin. Great experience learning how a bunch of businesses work and managing people.  \n \nWorked mainly in: Computer manufacturing, software, consumer lending, retail manufacturing, retail (stores) and venture capital. Learned a lot about software revenue recognition and stock option compensation, and how convoluted they are. \n \nClients included Power Computing (first authorized cloner of Apple computers), EZCorp (owner / operator of 350+ pawn shops), Austin Ventures & Texas Growth Fund (VCs), Human Code (educational software), MyTech (occupancy-sensing lighting technology), and a bunch of others. \n \nRecommended for early promotion to manager. Opted for career change instead, moving to L.A. to go to music school while working my way into a start-up in Austin.

Vice President / Snr Director Product Management - Yahoo Media Yahoo! Inc. April 2009  \u2013  January 2013  (3 years 10 months) Sunnyvale, CA This is really two roles combined into one description. In one role I was the product lead for Yahoo News which was one of the world's biggest news sites in something like 25 countries.  \n \nIn the other role I was taking the building blocks of Yahoo News - article pages, photo galleries, videos and lists - and bottling up that product for other Yahoo sites to use as well so that they didn't have to reinvent the wheel.  \n \nSo in these roles I spent a lot of time thinking and testing and pouring over data about how users consume content, I learned what it takes to build and ship a product across devices and I learned what it takes to build, ship and manage a product globally. I also helped move our dev teams from shipping pretty infrequently to at least once a week, globally, across devices, across many experiences. Amazing learning experience. \n \nFor those who care about this kind of thing, I was promoted to VP around March 2012. So I was a senior director for part of the time in this role.

I didn't declare a major (or what Wharton calls a concentration) until my last semester - I just took the most interesting classes and professors that I could afford for 1.5 years. In my last semester, turns out that my coursework qualified me for a concentration in marketing. \n \nThe class that I worked the hardest in: MKTG 896 - Probability Models in Marketing. It was basically PhD coursework in quantitative marketing research methods and data modeling. Taught by Peter Fader. \n \nMostly I just focused on classwork, meeting people and travelling.
