Built the YUI3 version of a \"search as you type\"\u200b widget internally known as \"Search Assist\". Web Technologies Evangelist Yahoo! May 2006  \u2013  February 2008  (1 year 10 months) Sunnyvale, CA Worked alongside Douglas Crockford (inventor of the JSON data format, well known author, and conference speaker), Iain Lamb (co-founder of OddPost), and Bill Scott, as part of Yahoo's \"Ajax evangelism\" team, a group that provided architectural assistance to Yahoo developers on the design and implementation of rich interactions in the browser. \n \nEvangelized best practices in frontend engineering with regard to performance, reliability, security, accessibility, maintainability, and design innovation. My responsibilities included: \n \n* Reviewing architectural designs and analyzing code. \n* Rapidly producing working prototypes. \n* Creating and delivering training materials to frontend engineers. \n \nDuring that time, I worked closely with the Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Search teams, consulted with many Yahoo properties, and also contributed the YUI Browser History Manager \u2014 a library dealing with browser history in single page applications \u2014 and the YUI Compressor \u2014 a JavaScript and CSS minification tool \u2014 to the YUI library.

Among other things, I had to reverse engineer the format of 100+ undocumented binary MAPI properties used internally by Microsoft Outlook and Exchange for calendaring and scheduling. I also developed the entire client logic and user interface, including complex algorithms to deal with: \n \n* Optimal display of overlapping appointments (problem known as bin packing) using a custom designed graph reduction algorithm implemented in JavaScript. \n* Handling of complex recurrence patterns in multiple time zones. \n* Computing and rendering of Free/Busy data. \n \nDesigned and developed a set of reusable DHTML user interface widgets (menu, toolbar, tree view, scrollable grid, rich text editor, etc.), a drag-and-drop library, a cross-browser DOM manipulation library, a date manipulation library, etc. \n \nWrote a set of tools for web developers (including a JavaScript preprocessor and a JavaScript obfuscator) in Java, and streamlined the entire build system (Apache Ant), improving developer productivity. Software Engineer easyplanet March 2001  \u2013  December 2003  (2 years 10 months) Contributed to the design and implementation of the easyplanet Community Desktop\u2122, a social media Windows-based application integrating tabbed browsing with multimedia features, and displaying company brand image and real-time content for the use of large media and entertainment companies. \n \nImplemented an Apache 1.3.x module, in C, used for user authentication and load-balancing with fail-over and session affinity. \n \nDesigned and developed the user interface (Delphi, Borland VCL) of an IM application. \n \nDeveloped the audio and video capture modules (C++, Win32, DirectShow) and the user interface (C++, Borland VCL) of a video conferencing application based on the OpenH323 library. I also participated in developing an extension to the OpenH323 library in order to support the dynamic switching of video codecs during a conversation without the need to hang up. That switch was automatic based on live bandwidth measurements during the conversation. \n \nContributed to easyplanet's social bookmarking service (Java) \n \nDeveloped the user interface of the easyplanet web-based email client. \n \nContributed to installing, setting up, and administrating production servers.

Senior Software Engineer Scalix January 2004  \u2013  May 2006  (2 years 5 months) San Mateo, CA Worked on the industry's best web-based email and calendaring solution (two-time winner of the LinuxWorld Product Excellence Award, made the cover of InfoWorld magazine, etc.) \n \nDesigned and developed the industry's richest web-based calendaring and scheduling software, on par with the level of functionality offered by native applications such as Microsoft Outlook. Among other things, I had to reverse engineer the format of 100+ undocumented binary MAPI properties used internally by Microsoft Outlook and Exchange for calendaring and scheduling. I also developed the entire client logic and user interface, including complex algorithms to deal with: \n \n* Optimal display of overlapping appointments (problem known as bin packing) using a custom designed graph reduction algorithm implemented in JavaScript. \n* Handling of complex recurrence patterns in multiple time zones. \n* Computing and rendering of Free/Busy data. \n \nDesigned and developed a set of reusable DHTML user interface widgets (menu, toolbar, tree view, scrollable grid, rich text editor, etc.), a drag-and-drop library, a cross-browser DOM manipulation library, a date manipulation library, etc. \n \nWrote a set of tools for web developers (including a JavaScript preprocessor and a JavaScript obfuscator) in Java, and streamlined the entire build system (Apache Ant), improving developer productivity.
