Each gateway will support multiple Spot beams and hence covering multiple regions and countries. \nEach Gateway is connected to either ISPs or to a private network infrastructure for providing end user customers with Internet service or enterprise service respectively. CISCO ASR (Aggregation Services Route) routers are used to provide this connectivity. BGP is the primary routing protocol used between Gateway ASR routers and external peer routers, and also between IP Gateways and ASR routers.  \n \nWork Responsibilities: \n\u2022 Assurance for timely change and Upgrade of Devices and Network Structure. \n\u2022 Migration to Newer Technologies, Operating System Upgrades \n\u2022 Handling Critical and High Severity Incidents \n\u2022 Work with Customers, Vendors, and staff to produce Network designs. This involves detailing Network requirements and Equipment to implement different designs, producing network design documents such as drawings and recommendations for a particular approach, and the presentation of same to technical staff and management. \n\u2022 The primary responsibility is to proactively monitor and resolve application, system or network incidents affecting the network quickly and ensure maximum availability and performance. \n\u2022 Served as a coordination point for communications between internal and external customers, engineering teams, other operations teams during events which affect the network. Network Operations Center (NOC) Engineer Hughes Network Systems August 2014  \u2013 Present (1 year 1 month) HNS YahSat Network will have four HN gateways each gateway will support multiple Out routes. These gateways are going to be located at following locations,  \nMadrid  \nLuxemburg  \nAthens  \nAbu Dhabi  \nAll four gateways will work on YahSat Satellite Y1B.
