My BS project was focused on speech enhancement. I received MSc. and PhD all in Electrical and Computer Engineering with specialization in communication and information systems at University of Waterloo, Canada, in 2006 and 2011, respectively. My Masters thesis was focused on video motion estimation which I applied pattern recognition techniques for motion tracking over sequence of video frames. My other works include video shot detection via information theoretic classification. During my PhD, I designed an adaptive MAC protocol based on IEEE 802.11p standard to optimize the quality of video communication in highly mobile ad-hoc networks. I also applied pattern classification techniques to optimally select the communication relays for video distribution in vehicular netrworks. I am skilled in pattern recognition, image processing, video compression standards and rest-based web service development.

Here are a few notable projects: \n \nY! Advertising Analytics: Built first deep analytics product for advertisers by integrating search and display campaign data with audience engagement data on Yahoo! Network. The product provided deep insight to advertisers about how users were engaging with their campaigns across different channels. It is one of the most appreciated products by Yahoo! Sales, impacting millions in renewal dollars and additional business from advertisers. \n \nY! Audience Analytics: As part of the audience analytics team, developed interesting products that provided a complex understanding of user engagement on the Yahoo! Network, as well as built products which helped increase customer awareness throughout Yahoo! properties. \n \n \nUser Value/Lifetime Value: System computes the value generated by the user on each property in addition to the entire Yahoo! network,also predicting lifetime value of the given segment of users. \n \nPath Analysis Platform: The platform to analyze the funnel, inflow/outflow and frequently used path by 500 million+ users on 5 million+ pages resulting in billions of page views on Yahoo! \n \nDigits(near real-time reporting): First near real-time reporting application to provide engagement metrics segmented by demographic & geographic for all Yahoo! properties. \n \nConversion Analysis: Built multiple versions of end-to-end platform to understand the effectiveness of the internal marketing campaigns. \n \nRecommendation System: Built the Affinity Engine(US Patent# 6873996) to compute similarity and worked with multiple properties such as Yahoo! Personals, Hotjobs, Y! Music, Y!Education and many more to deploy recommendations to increase the user engagement. \n \nCIA/FBI: Data driven applications to discover competitors for the given domain and measure revenue impact of marketing and engagement events.
