An automated response is now expected from the Development SMEs within a reasonable amount of time, and failure to do so results in chasing for a response until validation has been confirmed.

Experience Lead Engineer - Next Generation Workplace Services Project HP (Shell Account) October 2014  \u2013 Present (11 months) Having completed the Moka5 project, I was asked to stay on and assume another project role for HP on the Shell Account. \n \nI am working with the Chief Architect, Lead Architects, Chief Engineer and managing globally dispersed Engineering resources to deliver new capabilities for the End User Computing (EUC) environment at Shell. \n \nThe Initial focus is on File Storage, Printing and Windows Client. Utilising cloud solutions where possible and attempting to automate and instrument all aspects of the service, driving towards a NoOps model. \n \nThis includes schedule Creation and Management, coordination of Engineering resources in multiple global locations. Evaluating new solutions to best meet the customers requirements and cost profile, creating detailed Design documents and producing Test strategies and implementation activities. \n \nMultiple NGWS workstreams are in progress and I divide my time accordingly. \nAt all times, I ensure that the solutions I engineer are in accordance with the Shell's business requirements. \nI have enjoyed becoming familiar with new concepts of Object Storage, Enterprise File Sync and exploring the use of HP's 3PAR Storage technology.  \n \nThe technologies in use are SharePoint 2013, Windows Storage Server 2012 R2, BranchCache.

Responsible for all technical aspects of project delivery. Delivering the detailed design, automation spec, fulfilment processes etc. \n \nI optimised the Shell corporate desktop image (32bit & 64bit) for the Moka5 virtual container and included a custom setup wizard of my own design to guide Users through the initial boot and assist with Windows configuration that would usually be carried out by a Field Service Engineer. \n \nThe custom setup Wizard was very popular and I completed other development work for HP/Shell, I created a tool for exporting Secure Email encryption certificates to a Smart Card to support the Secure Mobile Email initiative at Shell. \n \nI Delivered Development, Pre-Production and Production Moka5 Server environments in AWS each including a discrete Active Directory for Moka5 User accounts. Development and Pre-Production are spun up only during upgrade/development cycles to save cost. \nI managed the successful DR failover test, bringing up a parallel VPC in a different AWS Region and restoring the instances and data. This relied on several key AWS technologies to ensure a rapid restoration of service. \n \nI provided extensive support scripts for the service desk and was able to use my prior experience to prevent project delays. \n \nThe Service went operational on schedule, capable of on-boarding 100 users per day due to the automation I engineered for the solution. \n \nI created Moka5 hostcheck Compliance scripts for Mac and PC to meet Shell IRM requirements, this allowed Users with un-managed hosts to access the Moka5 service, increasing the target scope for Shell Users. \n \nOnce operational, I managed a PoC to test the latest Moka5 BareMetal Player release.
